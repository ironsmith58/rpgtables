# DESCRIPTION: Dangers of the Nentir Vale
#              Steal this Hook
#              by Robert Wiese
#     The Nentir Vale. Described in the Dungeon Master's Guide, the Nentir Vale is a frontier area with sparse
#     population and lots of monstrous threats.
#     All of these elements by Robert Wiese from the WotC website
#     Adventuring in Nentir
#     The civilized world has been reduced to a series of points of light in a great wilderness of danger and monsters.
#     The mighty empire of Nerath fell long ago, and the Bloodspear War devastated the Nentir Vale and surrounding lands.
#     Into this outpost of civilization your campaign’s player characters have been dropped. The world depends on them,
#     and their bravery, to stem the tide of dangers that still threaten the small pockets of civilization.
#     Sound like a great intro to a post-apocalypse movie, doesn’t it? That statement also describes a new philosophy of the D&D game.
#     The setting has a lot more room in which to adventure, and a lot more danger exists in that area.
#     This month, we look at hooks that involve dangers from the unknown wilderness.

_
_<h3>Introduction:</h3>
_This table is based on 2 articles from the WotC website: <A href="http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4hook/20080731a">Dangers or the Nentir Vale</A> and
_ <A href="http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4hook/20080916a">Further Exploring the Nentir Vale</A> by Robert Wiese. They are from the "Steal This Hook" series.
_<p>All of the people and places described here are from the Nentir Vale as described in the <b>4E Dungeon Master's Guide</b>. The Nentir Vale
_ is a frontier area with sparse population and lots of monstrous threats.
_<p><b>Adventuring in Nentir:</b> <i>(exerpt from the original article)</i>
_<br>The civilized world has been reduced to a series of points of light in a great wilderness of danger and monsters. The mighty empire of Nerath fell long ago,
_ and the Bloodspear War devastated the Nentir Vale and surrounding lands. Into this outpost of civilization your campaign’s player characters have been dropped.
_ The world depends on them and their bravery to stem the tide of dangers that still threaten the small pockets of civilization.
_<p>Sound like a great intro to a post-apocalypse movie, doesn’t it? That statement also describes a new philosophy of the D&D game.
_ The setting has a lot more room in which to adventure, and a lot more danger exists in that area. This month, we look at hooks that involve dangers from the unknown wilderness.
_<p><b>Tablesmith:</b>
_<br>This table will generate 1 of 6 adventure hooks. Of each hook generated there are 5 or 6 different sets of details that are possible.
_<p> Possible hooks are:
_<li>Slaves of the Drow</li>
_<li>What Happened in Hammer’s Deep?</li>
_<li>The Haunted Winterbole</li>
_<li>Hired Muscle</li>
_<li>A Surge in Wagon Repairs</li>
_<li>I Want My Ancestral Land</li>
_<p><b>Images:</b>
_<br>There are images that this table can make use of but are not included here. To download the images

;Hook
1,Slaves of the Drow
_|Temp=%Path1%stealhook_20070731_1.jpg" align="right%Path3%|
_|Summary={Spc~5}A poster in the center of Fallcrest was tacked on several trees near the parts of town where people frequently visit.
_ “Winterhaven needs help! Please come before no one is left.” That’s all it says. Written in rough script, it nonetheless offers excitement.
_ “Meet me at the Blue Moon tonight” it says on the bottom. “More will be revealed of this tragedy to those interested in helping.”|
1,What Happened in Hammer’s Deep?
_|Temp=%Path1%stealhook_20070731_2.jpg" align="right%Path3%|
_|Summary={Spc~5}Sitting outside at a tavern on the edge of Hammerfast, you see a dwarf stagger into town from the east and fall to the ground.
_ From where you sit, you can hear him mumbling “dwarves gone, dwarves gone,” as if he’s trying to remember something.
_ You can tell that without serious healing he won’t survive more than a few minutes. He looks up, and as soon as he sees you,
_ he starts this story in a kind of panic as if he doesn’t think he’ll live to finish it.
_<br>{Spc~5}“Deep beneath the Dawnforge Mountains, dwarves mine for the minerals that are traded and worked in Hammerfast and the lands to the south.
_ One of their main settlements is called Hammer’s Deep. When I arrived there yesterday, I found the entire city deserted.
_ No bodies, no dwarves, no animals, nothing alive at all. As I was looking around, I heard large creatures moving in the main tunnel from below,
_ and grunts and howls and a lot of scary sounds. I admit, I ran. Fast. I’ve been running ever since, without any rest.
_ Something pursued me, though. Flying shadowy creatures attacked me as I reached the Vale. I found the energy to flee them,
_ but they attacked again just a few thousand yards from here. I couldn’t escape them and was left for dead. I managed to get here after that…”|
1,The Haunted Winterbole
_|Temp=%Path1%stealhook_20070731_3.jpg" align="right%Path4%|
_|Summary={Spc~5}“So, my cousin lives in Nenlast, a tiny place up by Lake Nen,” says the loquacious woman who sits down at your table in the Blue Moon Alehouse in Fallcrest.
_ “There’s probably not more than 100 or so people in the whole village, which was bigger before the Bloodspear War.
_ But then, what wasn’t? Anyway, my cousin’s in trouble, and that’s why I wanted to talk to you.”
_ As she says this, she gestures to the barkeep for another round for your table.
_<br>{Spc~5}“Nenlast is just south of the Winterbole Forest on the east side of Lake Nen, and they fish there. It’s not at all exciting,
_ and I don’t know why the poor man stays. Especially with the haunting. Oh, yes, they’re haunted. At least, that’s what he wants me to believe.
_ He wrote that something in the forest has been active, and that strange noises and cries echo out of the woods every few nights.
_ Probably a lot of drink in those noises, because what else do you do at night in a remote place like that. But then again, it might be true.
_ I’d like you to go there and take a look for me. He is my cousin, after all, and what kind of a relative would I be to ignore his plea for help.”|
1,Hired Muscle
_|Temp=%Path1%stealthishook_0916_2.jpg" align="right%Path4%|
_|Summary={Spc~5}Local bandits have joined forces with a tribe of gnolls.
_<br>{Spc~5}"I'm almost out of business, and I need help," the woman sitting before you says. "When my husband died in the wilderness,
_ I carried on his trading business, and I use different wagoneers to carry my goods from Fallcrest down to Harkenwold, and north to Winterhaven,
_ and even south to the more civilized lands. The bandits have been especially hard on my business in the past few months,
_ and my last goods were sent with a wagon train south to Harkenwold two weeks ago. I have not received word that the goods arrived,
_ and I am worried. If I lose this load, I'm finished. I don't have much money left, but I want to use what I have to hire you to go south
_ and see if my wagon arrived in Harkenwold. If it did not, please find out what happened to it. Can you help me?"|
1,A Surge in Wagon Repairs
_|Temp=0|
_|Summary={Spc~5}The road from Fallcrest toward Hammerfast sees few, if any, events of interest. Little trade passes this way, and few travelers make the journey.
_ That very day, in fact, has been relatively quiet. Birds sing in the distance, and some animals occasionally come into view,
_ then leave again. In the distance, you see what looks like a squat wagon. Sounds of an angry person come from that direction. As you get closer,
_ you see that it is a wagon, but its wheels lie broken on the ground. The traces are empty, so where the horses are is anybody's guess.
_ A man looks at the wreckage, and then off to the south, and then back at the wagon, muttering angry words all the while.
_<br>{Spc~5}If approached, the man says that he was carrying cargo from Fallcrest toward Hammerfast when his wheels splintered and then fell apart.
_ In the resultant crash, the horses panicked, broke their traces, and ran off toward the south.
_ The man's two brothers went off after the horses while the man remained to assess whether the wagon's wheels can be repaired.|
1,I Want My Ancestral Land
_|Temp=0|
_|Summary={Spc~5}The Blue Moon Alehouse is the best inn in Fallcrest, and you've stopped by to try out the fine ales and beers.
_ Your experience with Fallcrest also suggests that you can find adventure and glory here rather than at the cheap and rough Lucky Gnome.
_ You are sitting and listening to a young singer tell of the later days of the great empire of Nerath when a man across the room stands up.
_ He sways a little on his feet as he says, "Now that was a great time indeed! Those times should be restored!"
_ Then he takes a deep breath, steadies himself, and says, "And I have come to do just that! With a little help,
_ the greatest manor in this Vale can be great, and bring greatness with it. I need some heroes and can pay well for success.
_ I'll post a notice tomorrow, but if there are heroes who laugh at danger here in this very room, come talk to me. I'll buy."
_ And with that, he half-falls back into his chair and drains a mug.|


:Slaves of the Drow
01-40,People in Winterhaven are being kidnapped by drow raiders that come over the Cairngorm Peaks (or under them).
_ The slaves are taken into the Underdark through a tunnel north of the Winterbole.
41-55,The drow are working with gnolls and giants from the Stone March, and they give some of the captives to these humanoids for slaves or meals or to trade with other humanoid races.
56-65,People in Winterhaven feel a strong compulsion to go into the Cairngorm Peaks to look for gold. These compulsions are magical in nature and come during the night in dreams.
_ The people leave as soon as they wake up, with little or no equipment, and do not return.
66-85,Once in the Cairngorm Peaks, wyverns or a dragon hunt and kill the people, or the people are drawn toward a hidden gold mine that is run by a mind flayer.
_ The people become enslaved to the mind flayer and work the mine, forgetting their origins.
86-100,The people are disappearing because secretly a tale of drow enemies is circulating, and someone is recruiting hardy folk to form an army against the darkness.
_ Not all the townspeople are being told because those forming up the army prefer not to cause a panic.

:What Happened in Hammer’s Deep?
01-35,The underground city was attacked by undead flying creatures led by a ghost or lich.
_ All the people were driven off, and some are still alive in hiding. Every living thing was eaten or driven off.
36-50,A prophecy in this city says that a lava flow will break free into the city area and destroy everything,
_ and the people have been told by their gods that the prophecy is about to come true. Thus, everyone in the city left with their animals
_ to a place of safety to await the devastation, which had not come by the time the dwarf came by the city.
51-60,A disease was brought to the city, and madness ensued. The people turned on one another,
_ and a great bloodbath took place as everyone killed everyone else. Even the animals were slaughtered in the madness.
_ After everyone was dead, corpse feeders ate the remains. Visitors can see signs of what happened in the city,
_ but the dwarf did not remember them in the confusion of whatever drove him from the city. He might remember more with healing and quiet.
61-75,Demons broke into the world somewhere below the city, either because the dwarves mined down to them,
_ or because there was a weak spot in the fabric of reality, or because a wizard or warlock was creating the breach in her hidden base beneath the city.
_ When the demons broke through it, they made their way up to the city and slaughtered everything. They have since moved on and might even have reached
_ the surface by the time the PCs reach the area. A demon horde would be a significant problem for the PCs and the residents of the Nentir Vale.
76-85,The people of the dwarven city are still there as ghosts that cannot be perceived.
_ They walk the line between this plane and the Plane of Shadow, waiting for help. They have limited means of communicating with the real world, so their attempts look like hauntings or attacks.
86-100,A deep dragon has moved into the city and set up its lair there, since the place is empty and all.

:The Haunted Winterbole
01-35,The noises come from a woodland cult that is sacrificing fey creatures to an evil god or demon. The cult is careful to stay away from Nenlast,
_ and it is not aware that its noises have been heard. If the cult did find out, it would probably do what it could to enhance the
_ legend of the haunted woods so that the people of Nenlast would leave the cult alone.
36-45,The source of the noises is a community of treants and shambling mounds that are fighting over a tract of wooded land.
_ Elves and eladrin in the area are trying to prevent the destruction of the woods, but mostly they are caught in the middle and killed.
46-65,A ghost of a man who was killed by an evil satyr or a green dragon haunts these woods. He cannot pass on until a condition is met.
66-75,The noise comes from a group of Bloodspear orcs that have settled this far east, and they are logging in the woods.
_ They are creating the impression of supernatural events to keep the people of Nenlast away. After they build up strength,
_ they plan to swoop down on Nenlast and take over the village. Part of that strength comes from a green dragon that lives in the main part of the Winterbole.
76-85,The makers of the noise also create fires that burn in the night, giving a ghostly flickering light
_ (because they use magic to make the fire light look otherworldly) that is dangerous to the woods.
_ A forest fire might break out in the area, and that would threaten Nenlast and possibly the entire vale.
86-100,Whatever was making the noise was recently slain by trolls, and so the haunting has apparently stopped by the time the PCs arrive in Nenlast.
_ But the trolls are a real danger, too, and if the PCs don’t go into the Winterbole, then the trolls come to Nenlast.
 
:Hired Muscle
01-40,The wagon did not arrive—however it was delayed. One of the other wagons in the train needed repairs (see also the next hook; you can make this a two-fer).
_ When the PCs catch up to it, though, a group of gnolls led by two humans attack it.
41-55,The gnolls hail from the Dawnforge Mountains, and they have allied with a group of human bandits for mutual financial gain. In brief,
_ the gnolls are dirt poor and find it difficult to move around in the human-settled lands. They need the humans to help them move around undiscovered so that they can make successful raids.
56-65,The gnolls and bandits are based in southern Nentir Vale in the vicinity of Harkenwold, but very little trade passes that way.
_ The main reason they chose that area as a base is that its remoteness makes it easier for the gnolls to hide and move around undetected.
66-75,The gnolls and bandits don't just raid caravans. They hire themselves out to the highest bidder (or any bidder)
_ and thus they sometimes work for one merchant against a competitor or rival.
76-85,The dead husband of the woman who hires the PCs was slain by bandits working for one of his rivals. The gnoll group now works for that same rival,
_ who is based in Fallcrest. The rival has several reasons to put the woman out of business -- at your discretion,
_ the main one could be that he wants to put her in a desperate economic situation so that she marries him.
86-100,The gnolls and bandits are not actually working together. The two human bandits know about and follow the gnoll raiders/thugs around the area.
_ They "join in" the raids, steal some things during the fight between the gnolls and traders, and then they slip off into the woods before the fight ends.
 
:A Surge in Wagon Repairs
01-45,The man is Niroon Skelan, and he is a trader. He works with his two brothers Velok and Serris Skelan. They have been traders for years,
_ with many successful runs between Fallcrest and Hammerfast. They have even traded along the Old King's Road to Harkenwold. They have never had a problem like this before,
_ and they thought that their wagon was in excellent shape.
46-60,The wagon was sabotaged by someone working for the merchant where the Skelan brothers got their goods (on the lower quays).
_ This person is working for the Raven Roost bandits, and he or she makes it easy for the bandits to swoop down on the disabled wagons and rob them.
_ Bandits do in fact attack poor Niroon Skelan and the PCs while they are alone at the wagon.
61-70,The wagon saboteur is in league with orcs from the Old Hills and the nearby woods instead of bandits. Orcs attack the PCs at the wagon site.
71-85,The wagon saboteur had a personal grudge against the Skelan family and is not connected to bandits.
_ However, bandits in the vicinity see the running horses and find the disabled wagon anyway, creating an apparent connection between the saboteur and the bandits.
_ Sorting that confusion out proves difficult because of the coincidental nature of the connection.
86-100,The saboteur is actually in the wagon. It is not a person or creature, but it is a magic item that rotted the wood of the wheels
_ (and the whole wagon, which PCs can see once they closely examine it). This magic item was not supposed to be in the wagon, and the Skelans know nothing about it.
_ But someone does, since it was put in the wagon by an agent in Fallcrest. The receiving party is supposed to attack the wagon near Hammerfast and recover the item.
_ By this means, no one would have known it was being transported at all.
 
:I Want My Ancestral Land
01-35,The man introduces himself as Vencat Kalton, last of the Kalton family. He has come to restore Kalton Manor to greatness.
_ To accomplish this, he needs to clear the denizens of the Witchlight Fens and the Harken Forest to a distance of about 10 miles from the manor itself,
_ post his boundary, and hire people to keep the evil creatures out.
36-45,Vencat Kalton is the last of his family because he killed the rest off so that he could claim this frontier estate.
_ He had never seen it and did not know what happened to Lord Arrol Kalton when he hatched this scheme.
_ He is pretty motivated to clear it out and claim it because he really did not like killing off his family as much as he thought he would.
_ Their deaths should mean something, he believes -- even though they died at his hands.
46-65,Kalton is finding the task of claiming his estate to be overwhelming because just about anything evil and nasty could be living in the Fens or the Harken Forest.
_ In fact, a lot of nasty things do live there and any "heroes" who sign on with him have their work cut out for them.
66-75,The speaker is a very human-looking half-elf named Beroal Stalkan, a con artist and small-time criminal.
_ He met and slew the real Vencat Kalton and is trying to claim the manor in his name.
76-85,On the other hand, there might be no Kalton family left in the world anywhere, and Stalkan is making it all up to that
_ he can get in and loot the manor while the "heroes" are off slaying monsters in his name.
86-95,Goblins living in the Harken Forest are not going to take kindly to being evicted, though they could be hired to act as guards later if the PCs and Kalton/Stalkan can make the right deal.
96-100,"Kalton" could be just a drunk man in the tavern, with no connection to Kalton Manor of any kind. But if pressed,
_ he could describe stories he has heard of the size of the treasure supposedly buried in or under the ruins of the manor.
