141,I am a box,<br>Full of that which is most rare.<br>But it isn't a flute,<br>And it isn't some hair.<br>Though soft be my bed,<br>I am as hard as a rock.<br>And though dull in the darkness,<br>I glisten once unlocked.<br>What am I, this box so strange?<br>To hold such a treasure,<br>Which is not so plain.

144,When I looked upon the flames of his passion,<br>And the coolness of her touch,<br>I knew tragedy could only come from their union.<br>And indeed, when they came together,<br>Darkness reigned upon the land.<br>And although they were soon separated,<br>Learning as they did that they were not for each other,<br>Still, their passing regards for each other,<br>Left it's impression upon all who had witnessed it.<br>And would be talked about for ages still to come.
145,Oh woe is me!  Woe is me!<br>To have lost that which I can never buy back!<br>To be unable to recall that which has transpired!<br>Let my breath be returned!<br>Let time recoil!<br>Let this not be so!<br>Oh woe is me!  Woe is me!
