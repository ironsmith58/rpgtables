#    MAGUFFIN: In fiction, a MacGuffin (sometimes McGuffin or maguffin) is a plot device in the form of some goal,
#    desired object, or other motivator that the protagonist pursues, often with little or no narrative explanation. 
#    The specific nature of a MacGuffin is typically unimportant to the overall plot. The most common type of
#    MacGuffin is an object, place or person; other, more abstract types include money, victory, glory, survival,
#    power, love, or some unexplained driving force.
#    The MacGuffin technique is common in films, especially thrillers. Usually the MacGuffin is the central focus
#    of the film in the first act, and thereafter declines in importance. It may re-appear at the climax of the
#    story, but sometimes is actually forgotten by the end of the story. Multiple MacGuffins are sometimes
#    derisively identified as plot coupons.

_<P><i>Kudus to the author who set this all out - I can't remember where I got it but can only take credit for the conversion to Tablesmith Table.  Please let me know if you know who the author is/was.  Also some additional work can be do to correct the re-rolling of (double themes) and multiple settings and Minor villians.  There is also place to add refences to existing tables like NPC generators, quirks, locations, names, plots, etc. <br>J.B. Willers - September 2011</i></p>

_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="Theme">Theme</a></p>
_<P><i>"As he edged toward the lip of the darkened pit, Tornalar could hear the wet, slapping sound made by the mouements of its monstrous inhabitant. The hair on the back of his neck rose as he realized he was to face something man had never been meant to see..". </i></p>
_<P>The THEME of the adventure is the manner in which it’s played. Each different theme has different ground rules which affect the way the adventure is Dungeon-Mastered, and these ground rules also affect the emotions and perceptions of the player-characters. A Comedy adventure, for instance, is played for laughs. In the earliest part of the adventure, the players should be running into amusing situations which cue them in to the fact that nothing here really needs to be taken seriously. A Horror adventure, on the other hand, should start off scary and stay that way until the end.</p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="Goal">Goal</a></p>
_<P><i>"The job was simple all he and his friends had to do was conduct the bewitching lllyria to the border and safety. Trouble was, every royal guard and assassin within four hundred miles wanted her and the bounty she represented..".</i></p>
_<P>Sometimes, the adventure’s theme will dictate a GOAL. A Mystery, for instance, means the characters’ goal is to find out who did the crime. Not ail themes have built-in goals, though. </p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="StoryHook">Story Hook</a></p>
_<P><i>"The stumbling man collapsed into Toronar’s arms, and the warrior realized with a start that this was no drunkard-it was Mendelen, his oldest friend and shield-brother. Mendelen spoke, in spite of the pain from the fatal sword-wound in his back: “Watch out for... the standing stone,” he gasped out, then perished..".</i></p>
_<P>The STORY HOOK (also called a MAGUFFIN) is the plot device you use to bring your characters into the story and give them an interest in the story. It’s not enough merely to create an interesting adventure; you have to tie your characters in to it. Often, it’s enough just to tie one player-character to the adventure: if the other characters are his friends and companions, they’ll usually stick with him. If not, you may have to use several different hooks to drag characters into the same story.</p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="GeneralSetting">Specific Setting</a></p>
_<P><i>"It would be good to see home again, Tornalar decided, with its familiar faces and easy slow pace and old-style courtesy. But the great pillar of smoke he espied before making the final turn in the road was a sure sign not everything was going to be as he remembered it..." </i></p>
_<P>Now, you can choose the SETTINGS where this adventure will be taking place. Choose one General Setting and one or more Specific Settings for the placement of your adventure. General Setting The adventure’s General Setting is the broad area where most of the adventure takes place.</p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="SpecificSetting">General Setting</a></p>
_<P>Now, you can choose specific locales for scenes in your adventure. You can choose as many of these as you want; usually two is best. Be sure to discard any choices which just can’t be coordinated with your choice of a General Setting. For instance, if you chose a Cosmopolitan City, then “Caves of Magical Folk” is possible but unlikely; “Legendary Forest” is very unlikely, unless it’s just next door; “Palace of the Ruler” is very appropriate.<br />
_<strong>Start-Points</strong><br> You have to get your heroes to these places; usually, they start their adventure in whatever city or village is their home and have to travel to the primary setting of the adventure. That’s what the Story Hooks and Maguffins are all about.</p>
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="NPCAlliesNeutrals">NPC's - Allies & Neutrals</a></p>
_<P><i>“In MY day,” grumped the old swabbie, “we didn’t have it easy like you. None of this tacking with the wind; we could only sail straight before it, or row. And stone anchors, I used to hate those stone anchors.. .” Tornalar rolled his eyes. “You’re daft, grandfather. Men haven’t sailed like that in u thousand years.” “So YOU know so much, YOU sail ‘er!” </i></p>
_<P>One of the most entertaining parts of dungeon-mastering is the opportunity to portray some interesting NPC in effect, to chew up the scenery with some entertaining character, both to spice up the game and to challenge the players to play their own characters more vigorously. Here are several such ALLIES and NEUTRALS which can be part of your adventure. Roll up one character from the following chart (or more, if you prefer); if he’s the sort of character who could accompany the heroes on their adventure, contrive to make him necessary to their quest; if he’s not, have them encounter him in the course of their adventuring.<br />
_<b>Character Hooks</b><br>One last note: For every NPC you portray, you need to think up a Character Hook which will serve to establish the NPC’s personality in the minds of your heroes. Some such mannerisms include: Calling Heroes by the Wrong Name; Lying Compulsively and Obviously; Nervous Giggling; Nose-In-the-Air Disdain; Rotten Memory; Quavery Voice; Sniping at Everyone; and Talking to Himself.</p>
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="MasterVillians">Master Villians</a></p>
_<P><i>"The demon Hashkoreth stretched, his muscles popping and his wings rustling like the wind, and then settled down to contemplate his map of the continent. With bofd strokes of his charcoal pen, he swiftly modified it: “See, here, we incinerate the elven forest to a lovely charred hue and then bring up a volcano to break up the horizon a little bit. Let us lose this human city and the surrounding land to make the gulf a little more symmetrical. And these plains will make a lovely desert…"</i></p>
_<P>Of course, every adventure needs its MASTER VILLAIN, the hateful dastard who stands behind all the evil plans, who sponsors the monsters and the curses, who tries again and again to foil or kill our heroes. You may find, if you random-roll your villain, that he does not match the story elements you have previously chosen. The Lovable Rogue, for instance, is not the best Master Villain to have for a depressing, doom-laden episode, while he is perfect for high adventure on the open seas. So if you roll a Master Villain that doesn’t work, just discard your roll and roll again until you’ve found an appropriate villain. </p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="MinorVillians">Minor Villians</a></p>
_<P><i>"As the vexed Tornalar watched, his archenemy’s minion, the dextrous and charming Despar, leaped up into the windowsill. “You’ll excuse me, I hope,” the villain called happily, “but my rope is here and I can’t keep it waiting.” Reaching out, he caught the swinging line, gave Tornalar and lllyria an alltoo-familiar fond salute, and swung out of sight to safety".</i></p>
_<P>No Master Villain’s organization is complete without a couple of distinctive and interesting MINOR VILLAINS the chief lieutenants in his plans. Some Minor Villains are purely evil; some are mercenary; some just serve the villain for the wrong reasons or because they’re being forced to. Many Master Villains have two Minor Villains, so roll twice on the chart below for your adventure’s Minor Villains.</p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="Plot">Plot</a></p>
_<P><i>"Their task was simple. All they had to do was get into the walled city of Lur in the dead of night, while the city gates were closed and walls manned, make their way to the viceroy’s estate, kidnap him, and then get him back to camp before dawn. The hard part was surviving while they went about it.. " </i></p>
_<P>The PLOT of your adventure is the pattern in which the story elements fall and the order in which the story events occur. Below are five general plot arrangements which are especially suited to role-playing adventures. </p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="Climax">Climax</a></p>
_<P><i>"Hashkoreth screamed, for the first time since mankind was shaped, as Tornalar shattered his Crystal Heart. The demon’s backhand blow hurled the hero across the chamber, shattered his ribs, robbed his strength. But the hero could still see the demon double over in agony.. . and then Hashkoreth looked up in fearful amazement LIS he felt the rumbling in the ground, the rumbling as his hellish citadel, robbed of the Heart’s energies, began to shake itself apart at the seams..". </i></p>
_<P>The adventure’s CLIMAX is that point, near the story’s end, where the story is resolved: Great feats of daring are performed, important decisions are made, the heroes win or are defeated, and rulers or the gods reward the victors. In short, it’s the Big Finish. </p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="MonsterEncounter">Monster Encounter</a></p>
_<P><i>"A faint noise awoke Tornalar. The campfire was dim, still faintly popping and sizzling; his fellow companions seemed all to be safe in their bedrolls. He decided to ask if the guard had also heard the sound. But, as he looked toward the guardstation, there was no man there: The guard lay on the ground, his body savaged, and over him stood the massive bulk of some great furred beast. Moonlight shone on its teeth and claws and red. red eyes.. " </i></p>
_<P>You now enter the area of the Optional Adventure Elements. The first of these is the MONSTER ENCOUNTER. Fantasy adventures are much more colorful when the heroes have monsters to fight; the trick is to introduce monster encounters that have a purpose. Each of the monster encounters listed below has a purpose in an adventure. You can still random-roll them on the chart below; but advice for each encounter will give you p!ot-related ideas for how the monster can be used to advance the story. In general, you should have at least one monster encounter in an adventure; roll it up now and spring it on the players when things get dull, they get complacent, or the story seems to drag. You can always roll up another encounter if these conditions persist or occur again later in the adventure. For each monster type, we list several specific monsters which fit the bill. In your adventure, choose the one best suited to the heroes to be present during the monster encounter. </p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="NPCEncounter">NPC Encounter</a></p>
_<P><i>"The adventurer stiffened as he heard the woman shrilly utter his name: “Tomalar! There he is, guardsman! He’s the one who slew the governor, stole away his niece, defiled the temple and burned the West Quarter! After him!” Well, that was all true enough. Performed with the noblest of intents, of course. But Tornalar couldn’t stay around to convince a tribunal of that. He began to run.."</i></p>
_<P>Every so often, you’ll want to spice up an adventure with a CHARACTER ENCOUNTER a run-in with some interesting character which leads to a combat, chase, or other spot of trouble.</p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="TrapsDeathtrap">Traps & Deathtrap</a></p>
_<P><i>"The demon Hashkoreth gazed fondly at Tomalar and chucked lllyria under the chin. “You went to consider-able trouble to find where I mix that incr-edible exploding powder. 1 plan to reward you by letting you perish with the fortress where it was made. “Two stories below, my men have already set fire to the hallway outside the powder’s storage area... and have also fired all the exits from this fortress. I think you’ll find it a waste of time to try to escape. You did well.. . but you’ll die from not having done quite well enough.. ."</i></p>
_<P>TRAPS and DEATHTRAPS are staples of fantasy adventures; here are several traps with descriptions of what they can mean to your scenario. </p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="SpecialConditions">Special Conditions</a></p>
_<P><i>"The lighf cast by lllyria’s magic did illuminafe fhe chamber. But then if grew in infensify, filling the chamber with actinic brightness, nearly blinding the adventurers. “As I fhoughf,” she grumbled. “Everything I cast is either too strong or too weak. Magic just doesn’t work right in these caverns, Tornalar. I can’t count on my own powers.” </i></p>
_<P>You can complicate the heroes’ lives by giving them a SPECIAL CONDITION a condition which limits their effectiveness but which they must work under to be successful in the mission.</p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="Misguidance">Misguidance</a>
_<P><i>.“And there,” the old man breathed, “is the Lost City of Kubalak. Beautiful, isn’t it?” Illyria looked. The plain below was featureless. “I don’t see it. Where? Where is Kubalak?” “Oh, so I’m crazy, am I?” snarled the guide. “You’re just like the rest. Lock me up for another thirty years, will you? Not when I’m ruler of the mighty Kubalak, you won’t!” He charged down the hillside to the muddy plain, discarding his weapons, accoutrements, and clothes as he went, till he stood bare to the wind, happily wandering the streets and marketplaces of his imaginary city. Illyria sat down, defeated. Eight days lost, and there WAS no Army of Kubalak to help them against the demon. They were on their own.. "</i></p>
_<P>If the heroes are being too clever and efficient, you can lead them astray with a conveniently-planted Red Herring a clue which leads the heroes confidently in the wrong direction. Be careful: It’s possible, when using red herrings, to lead your characters into utter failure. Red herrings should be used as temporary frustrations and delays. Many of these Red Herrings won’t work for the plot you will already have chosen. The IdlOO roll table is provided below as a convenience, but you may find it more appropriate simply to choose the red herring which best fits the adventure as you’ve put it together so far. </p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="OmensProphecies">Omens & Prophecies</a></p>
_<P><i>"The palmist paled when she saw the birthmark, which others always mistook for the tattoo of a ram’s skull, which decorated Tomalar’s shoulder. “Get you from my tent,” she hissed. “That mark you bring destruction and death in your wake, as has everyone who has ever borne that mark...” </i></p>
_<P>A lagging adventure can be brightened up, or a cheerful group of adventurers can be alarmed, by skillfully-used Omens and Prophecies. Omens and Prophecies can be used in a variety of ways. Several of the ones used below can be used as Story Hooks to interest characters in the upcoming adventure. Others can be used to provide clues which can lead to the downfall of the master villain. </p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="MoralQuandary">Moral Quandary</a></p>
_<P><i>"lllyria shook her head furiously. “You gave me your word that you wouldstay and protect my family until the danger was past. And now that we KNOW the demon’s forces will be attacking tonight, you want to run away.” “If we strike his main camp tonight,” Tornalar protested, “we can deal him a blow which might just break his army into pieces.” “While my family dies! You gave your word.. ."</i></p>
_<P>If you want to give your characters a crisis which no amount of spellcasting or sword-swinging will resolve, present them with a MORAL QUANDARY. This is a problem of conscience, a problem for which the characters must make a single choice but not a simple one. </p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="Chase">Chase</a></p>
_<P><i>"Tomalar urged his horse on to greater speed. Up ahead, the whooping Despar held aloft the Crimson Sword, the only thing which could shatter Hashkoreth’s Crystal Heart.. But the roguish Despar was as good a rider as Tomalar, and his mount was fresher.. ."</i></p>
_<P>One of the most exciting elements of the adventure story is the CHASE, the part of the story where the heroes are desperately fleeing the villain and his minions, or where the villain and his minions are desperately fleeing the heroes. Here are some options. As with many other story elements, the chase is best dictated by the other parts of the story particularly the Setting. You may wish to choose the most appropriate Chase instead of rolling. </p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="SecretWeakness">Secret Weakness</a></p>
_<P><i>“The demon you speak of, whose name I dare not utter,” whispered the sage, “is immortal, invulnerable, unstoppable. No force known to man can harm his body; not even the gods can destroy him.” “Then we have lost,” lllyria breathed. The sage shook his head. “Not necessarily. There is a story.. . a story that he lost his heart to a demoness, before mankind was created. Literally he gave her his heart, plucked it from his breast, and she kept it. If it is still not within him, if it is not protected by his body, perhaps he has a weakness after all.. .” </i></p>
_<P>If your Master Villain is particularly powerful an ancient wizard or lich, a demon or devil, a god you’ll want to give him a SECRET WEAKNESS. This weakness is the key to his defeat. The heroes should hear from very early on that he has such a weakness; they must then figure out what it is to exploit it. (This can be an adventure in itself.)</p><br />
_<P style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="CruelTricksComplications">Cruel Tricks & Complications</a></p>
_<P><i>"lllyria paused. All she had to do was utter the words of her spell and Despar’s horse would be paralyzed. This might pitch the horse and Despar both off the clifftop where they rode.. . but even if they perished, the Crimson Sword would be unharmed. “Do it!” shouted Tornalar. “We can’t catch him any other way!” lllyria flinched, but did not utter her spell. Despar vanished from sight, the Sword still in his hand, and Tornalar’s hopes vanished with him. The adventurer turned on the sorceress, eyes ablaze. “Why didn’t you stop him?” ‘I might have killed him. I could not, Tomalar. Despar is my brother.. ."</i></p>
_<P>Finally, if you want to make life a little more hellish for your characters, you can give them one of the following CRUEL TRICKS AND COMPLICATIONS. At a crucial point in the story, you can spring a Cruel Trick on your heroes, forcing them to reevaluate their situation, abandon their mission, and refigure what they need to do. </p><br />

:!Theme
1,<b>Action/Adventure </b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is the most common and straightforward sort of adventure there is. In the Action/Adventure scenario you present your characters with a task and them confront them with obstacles to overcome in order to accomplish the task successfully.<br>
_<i>Characteristics:</i> Monsters, natural disasters, human enemies, many opportunities for the characters to show off their combat abilities and other skills.<br>
_<i>Ground Rules:</i> None. 
2,<b>Comedy </b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This adventure is fun for fun’s sake. Its basic purpose is to provide humorous entertainment with a minimum of actual danger or tragedy.<br>
_<i>Characteristics:</i>Plans that go horribly awry (for both heroes and villains), strange encounters, peculiar NPCs and monsters, witty dialogue, generally non-lethal encounters and situations.<br>
_<i>Ground Rules:</i> NPCs including the villains, should be more amusing than menacing: bumbling, witty or just strange. Even a very frightening villain should have some crack in his armor, a silly mannerism, a pretentious habit, a mental aberration (such as a sensitivity about his large nose). 
3,<b>Espionage </b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Espionage adventures are active, grim scenarios, involving spying and perhaps other cloak-and-dagger deeds such as assassination or rescue.<br>
_<i>Characteristics:</i>Characters are presented with a task and must devise an intricate and clever plan to accomplish the task. Other characteristics include grim, efficient enemies, betrayal, and many stealth-related encounters. Thieves, assassins, and rangers are especially useful.<br>
_<i>Ground Rules:</i> The task often calls for a minimum of bloodshed, i.e. the more people the characters kill, the less successful the mission. 
4,<b>Horror </b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This type of adventure is designed to scare both the characters and the players. Just having a monster attack is not enough for a horror theme; the monster must first frighten the characters.<br>
_<i>Characteristics:</i>Dark musty old settings, things creeping around in the dark, terrified NPCs, violent weather, inexplicable monsters.<br>
_<i>Ground Rules:</i> Use psychology to frighten the characters (keep creeping or shambling things at the very edges of their perception, tell them they have the feeling of something watching them, etc.); don’t use any monster exactly as written (give it strange abilities and behavior the characters can’t predict). 
5,<b>Mystery </b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Here, the characters are presented with a mystery often a murder and have to find out who did what to whom.<br>
_<i>Characteristics:</i>A murder or other crime; a MacGuffin to force the characters to investigate the crime; frequent (usually non-violent) interaction with civilian authorities.<br>
_<i>Ground Rules:</i> None. 
6,<b>Revenge </b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;In this adventure some villain has so offended one or more of the characters that he cannot be suffered to live. (Alternatively, the injured party could hire the characters to avenge his honor.) The villain must be found or otherwise gotten at, setting up the final duel or showdown between villain and characters.<br>
_<i>Characteristics:</i>The Insult (character or NPC must be mortally offended; the villain could steal his property, injure or kill his friend, lie to or about the character, etc.) This is a grim sort of adventure, characterized by strong emotions and violent encounters.<br>
_<i>Ground Rules:</i> None. 
7,<b>Romance</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This sort of adventure (rarely played - but worthwhile anyway) has as its central plot the romance between two characters usually a PC and an NPC.<br>
_<i>Characteristics:</i>You start with romantic interest between the characters and then you strew the road to love with obstacles. Some examples: Someone kidnaps one of the lovers; a lying NPC convinces one lover of something awful about the other; one lover finds he has to settle an old debt by marrying another; one lover belongs to a profession the other cannot stand (make sure it’s one the character is not willing to abandon without suffering); the lovers are from different social backgrounds and are opposed by both their families and society at large.<br>
_<i>Ground Rules:</i> None.
8,<b>Double Theme</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;[Theme]<br>[Theme]<br>

:!Goal
1,<b>Clear Name</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; The name of one of the characters or an NPC has been sullied and the characters must clear it. The characters must find out<br>(a) why the name has been smeared<br>(b) who is responsible and<br>(c) why the responsible party is doing it; then they must find evidence to convince everyone they’re telling the truth. 
2,<b>Escape</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; Early in the adventure the heroes are captured. The remainder of the adventure consists of them learning enough so that they can escape. They have to get to know their fellow prisoners, learn the prison’s routine, inventory their possessions, acquire other possessions they need, plan an escape, and execute it.
3,<b>Explore New Area</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; The heroes are hired or convinced to enter an unmapped area and explore it. They may be making a map; they may be trying to find someone who disappeared into this area in the past; they may be following legends that tell of treasure in the unexplored interior. 
4,<b>Encounter Old Villain</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; If your campaign has a villain who shows up again and again to bedevil the heroes then this is an episode featuring that villain.
# You might wish to roll once again on this page to see what the villain’s goal is.
_<br><u>Villain's Goal</u>: [~Goal] 
5,<b>Gain Money</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; The heroes are intent on acquiring a fee or treasure. If it’s a fee you may wish to roll again on this page to learn the patron’s goal. If it’s a treasure pay attention to the Settings page which will dictate where the treasure is if not who owns it.
_ <br><u>Fee's Goal (if needed)</u>: [~Goal]
6,<b>Gain Power</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; The heroes are on this adventure to gain personal or political power for themselves. They may be looking for an artifact or weapon or are performing a mission for someone who will reward them with political power (a higher social rank or lands for instance). If the characters are doing someone else’s bidding you might want to roll again on this page to see what goal the patron will have assigned to the characters. 
_ <br><u>Patron's Goal (if needed)</u>: [~Goal]
7,<b>Protect Endangered NPC(s)</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; One or more NPCs are in danger and the characters must protect him or them. They might be doing this for a reward or because one or more of the NPCs is a friend or relative of the character. You need to decide what the characters are protecting the NPC from. The NPC might by a wealthy or powerful person being sought by assassins or kidnappers. The NPC might be a whole village of peasants who are being terrorized by a bandit chieftain. 
8,<b>Rescue NPC(s)</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; The characters must rescue one or more kidnapped NPCs probably from the stronghold of the kidnapper. Obviously they must get to said stronghold; break in; rescue the kidnappee; break out; and escape back to safety; this usually requires careful and clever planning and a large dose of luck. 
9,<b>Retrieve Item</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This goal is like the Rescue except the victim is an inanimate object. This item may be an artifact; a paper containing evidence against a character or patron; an antidote needed to save another NPC or player-character or just some item of sentimental value, an item which one NPC hires the characters to steal from another NPC. 
_<br>(For information)<i> [Goal=8]</i>
10,<b>Settle a Debt</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; A player-character may find himself in the position of needing to settle a debt. He could gamble away all his money and need to raise some more to repay the gambling-house before its enforcers come for him. On a more personal level the character may need to settle a debt of either money or honor that he owes to an NPC. 
11,<b>Survive Environment</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; The characters could end up in a hostile environment which they must cross: a desert, a jungle, or other hostile setting. In the course of the adventure they’ll need to find food and water, resist the elements, and perhaps fight off attacks of the natives. 
12,<b>Thwart Monstrous Plan</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This is a classic fantasy-adventure plot. The characters learn of some horrible plan made by a monstrous enemy and must thwart it before the kingdom is lost or the world is destroyed. This is an epic goal and usually requires that the characters go to all sorts of places rounding up allies and artifacts before being strong enough to face their enemy. 
13,<b>Win War</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; In this adventure or set of adventures the characters become part of an army, a force assaulting another kingdom perhaps, or an army defending one realm from another.

:StoryHook
1,<b>Dying Delivery</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; On some occasion when the hero is out wandering the streets or is otherwise all alone, a dying man bumps into him, hands him something, says a few words, and dies. The deliverer can be dying of a curse, poison, a wound from a weapon, malnutrition caused by his long captivity, or from some bizarre and inexplicable cause. The dagger still protruding from his back is the most common cause of death among dying deliverers. The object given to the hero can be a famous weapon or artifact which has long been missing and presumed destroyed, an object which could not possibly have found its way into this wretch’s hands (such as the king’s crown or the most holy talisman of the 6 local church), or a sheaf of papers. If it’s a sheaf of papers, it can signify any number of things; it can be a certificate of birth, proving that some nobody is actually the heir to the kingdom (naturally, agents of the current “heir” will kill anyone who possesses it); it can be proof that an upstanding citizen is really the head of the city’s criminal syndicate (of course, said upstanding citizen is very anxious to get his hands on the papers, and on the heart of anyone who’s read them); it can be a duplicate scroll describing a ritual of monstrous demon-summoning whose elements are suspiciously reminiscent of events going on right now in the city. And the man’s dying words are the real hook. In general, they should tell the hero where to look next. If he names his killer, the hero will know to go take a look at the accused. If he describes where he was attacked, the hero will probably go there. If he tells the hero where to take this maguffin, then the hero will probably go there (even if he isn’t necessarily inclined to hand over the goods). If he says something inexplicable, like “Emerald eyes of the ram,” before dying, then the hero will be baffled until later, when he hears of the golden statue of a ram with emerald eyes being commissioned by some famous personage. 
2,<b>Grim Necessity</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; If the hero doesn’t involve himself with this adventure, he’s going to find himself suffering or dead period. That’s the hook to bring him into the adventure... but you have to determine why he’ll suffer or die if he doesn’t become involved. Some options:<br>(1) He’s been cursed or geased by some powerful caster of spells to accomplish some deed that leads him into the adventure. (If you choose this option, make a note of the fact that the hero may want to exact revenge on the spell-caster at the story’s end or in another adventure.)<br>(2) He’s been falsely accused or even convicted of a crime. The authorities are hunting him wherever he goes and they have magic-using allies, too, so he can‘t count on staying out of their clutches forever. He must pursue the clues that lead into the adventure, or he’ll forever be a fugitive.<br>(3) He’s been poisoned and has only a few days to find the antidote before he perishes. (According to his alchemist and wizard friends, this potent magical poison cannot be cured by clerical magic and will destroy his body when it kills him, so he can’t be raised; additionally, any clone made of him will be similarly poisoned.) 
3,<b>Hero Offended</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; Someone greatly offends the hero, so much so that he’ll pursue his offender right into the adventure. (Note that this usually means that the offender is a minion of the Master Villain. You’ll have to decide whether the minion offended the hero precisely to bring him into the adventure, or just as a sideeffect of his ordinary villain activities.) Ways for the NPC to offend our hero include:<br>(1) He can injure or kill someone well-liked or loved of the hero. This is best done when the hero isn’t around, or simply isn’t in a position to pursue the villain.<br>(2) He can steal or destroy some important property of the hero, such as a magical weapon or a family heirloom.<br>(3) He can cheat the hero. This is fun and requires some role-playing time, as this villain, pretending to be a legitimate merchant or professional, convinces the hero to buy some wondrous thing property, a title, a magical potion of irresistable attraction and then makes off with the fortune paid by the hero before the hero realizes he’s been had. 
4,<b>Legend and Rumor</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; In this classic story hook, the hero stumbles across some new or longforgotten knowledge that promises great treasure or gain. Some of these sorts of rumors include:<br>(1) Exact Placement of a Legendary Site. In an old, musty, rare document,.the hero comes across clues leading to the exact placement of some famous legendary site. (This is usually best for wizards and clerics to find, as they’re heavier readers than other types of characters.) The site must be famous for some treasure or other thing that the heroes will want.<br>(2) Legendary Danger Site. This sort of legend can be heard from the locals at taverns and inns near the site. Some place a valley, ruined castle, a lake is locally notorious for being dangerous and having some sort of treasure. While it’s widely-known, it’s sufficiently dangerous that no one has ever solved its mysteries.<br>(3) Jump Now, Look Later. Magical researches lead a wizard-character to be able to recreate some famous magical spell or effect but the character doesn’t exactly know what’s going to happen: His damaged scroll doesn’t precisely say. He needs to assemble some stout friends and conduct the ritual to find out why it’s so famous. It could transport them to an alternate plane or world, awaken a god who should have been left to sleep, complete some incredibly powerful eons-old spell effect which could change the face of the world, etc. 
5,<b>Mistaken Identity</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; The hero could be mistaken by one villain for another villain involved in the master plot. This has good comic potential if the hero and the missing villain are in fact so similar that no one can tell them apart. (This is even more fun if they turn out to be long-lost twins.) In this case, one villain will tell our hero something cryptic and important about the current state of the master plan, then leave, prompting our heroes to investigate.
6,<b>Mystery Woman</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; Create an NPC “mystery woman” sure to be fascinating to your hero and have her keep appearing inexplicably in his life. As he becomes interested and investigates her, he keeps stumbling across the villain’s plans and becomes inextricably mired in the plot. (For female player-characters, the Mystery Man is just as useful.) You’ll need to decide just what the Mystery Woman is. Some choices:<br>(1) Adventurer. The woman could be involved to turn a profit for herself; she could end up stealing the grand treasure out from under the hero’s nose.<br>(2) Agent. She could be a secret agent for local authorities; when this is the case, it’s usually best to make sure the hero becomes suspicious of her because she never tells the truth about her origins and motives. Only at the end, when she produces the king’s warrant, will he find out her true profession and motivations.<br>(3) Ghost. The woman could actually be some undead spirit not a killcrazed ghost, but an intelligent spirit who wants to help the heroes along in order to redress some old crime. Make sure that it’s a non-magical hero who becomes interested in her, and that she only appears in the most unusual of places and circumstances (in ruins, in the dark, away from other people).<br>(4) Innocent Endangered by Villain. In this classic role, the woman is in danger from the villain but can never seem to stay around long enough to tell the hero precisely why. As he pursues her to find out, he becomes enmeshed in the plot.<br>(5) Lover or Daughter of Villain. Here, the character is a concubine or daughter of the villain but really prefers the hero; bound by honor to help the villain, she nonetheless provides aid to the hero whenever she can. The tragic example of this role gets killed by the villain in the climax; the happily-everafter variety is rescued by the hero. 
7,<b>Old Enemy</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This is a straightforward story hook. The hero learns that his oldest enemy is back and is very active in the campaign, up to something. The hero will naturally want to investigate and will walk right into the story. 
8,<b>Old Friend</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; Another classic story hook is the Old Friend. The childhood friend of our hero, who shows up in one of several ways to drag the hero into the story. Some of the ways include:<br>(1) He Asks for Help. The Friend shows up to ask the hero for help. He or his family is being menaced by some side-effect of the villain’s plan. (The Old Friend could actually now be a traitor, leading the hero straight to his enemies, if you prefer.)<br>(2) He Is Killed. The Friend dies on the hero’s doorstep; the hero is obligated to investigate. There will be enough clues found on the Friends body to lead the hero into the plot. (As an interesting variant, the Old Friend can have become a villain and been killed by an NPC hero, leading to some confusion on the PCs’ part .) 
9,<b>Pressing Buttons</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; As a general story-hook approach, think about the player-character, his personal goals and his personal dislikes. If the hero is pursuing a specific goal, you have one of the minor villains, as a side-effect of the villains’ master plan, thwart the hero’s latest step toward that goal. If he’s a wizard developing a spell, the villains can steal all his notes and components; if he’s a soldier seeking advancement in rank, the villains can discredit him and get their own soldier advanced to that rank; if he’s a social climber wooing a high-ranking lady, the villain can do so as well. Any of these tricks will cause the hero to dislike the villains mightily, and the hero will investigate the villain right into the depths of the plot. Alternatively, if there’s something the hero truly hates to see, have it happen and have the villains be responsible. If the hero has established that he protects children, have one of the villains endanger or harm a child within his sight. If it’s political corruption the hero hates, have him see a friend or relative unjustly sentenced by a crooked magistrate. His inevitable investigations resulting from these events will lead him into the story.

:GeneralSettings
1,<b>Alternate Plane</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; Most of the story takes place in an alternate dimension. This implies that either the PCs or the villains, or both, have magic powerful enough to bridge the dimensional barrier, or that the PCs stumble across some dimensional portal. This setting gives you opportunities to introduce new magic, spells, monsters, treasures, and wholly different cultures. 
2,<b>Cosmopolitan City</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; Most of the story takes place in a large, sophisticated city. Center the villains’ plot and activities around that city. This setting is best suited to adentures involving more people than monsters; most of your villains should be human or demi-human. 
3,<b>Exotic Distant Land</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; The adventure will take the heroes to some fascinating and exotic distant country, where they’ll have to cope with new customs, monsters unfamiliar to them, and very colorful NPC encounters; choose one of the more fascinating foreign lands from your campaign world. This setting gives you the opportunity to plop your heroes down in interesting, uncomfortable or dangerous situations arising from their unfamiliarity with local laws and customs. 
4,<b>Hero’s Home Town</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; The action takes the heroes back to the home territory of one of them. Note that this usually means that this hero’s family or old friends are deeply involved in the adventure. This setting allows you to give the hero nostalgia episodes, where he trips across places and people who were important in his youth and can observe the changes to them. It also adds a sense of importance to otherwise casual events. A character should take a dim view of a villain threatening a town full of his dearest friends. 
5,<b>On the Road</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; Most of the adventure takes place on the road, as the heroes are travelling from place to place. This is especially good for adventures where heroes are investigating a wide-ranging mystery, are part of a caravan, or are being pursued by loathesome villains. This setting allows you to showcase lots of different settings in a short amount of real time; each separate encounter can take place in a different nation. 
6,<b>On the Sea</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; Most of the action occurs on the sea the heroes are shipborne for some reason, docking in lots of ports. Again, this is good for adventures where the heroes are investigating clues left all over the map, are part of some trading enterprise, or are being pursued by villains. This setting allows you to batter the heroes with mighty, terrifying storms, menace them with unusual and spectacular sea monsters, and annoy them with pirates and buccanneers. 
7,<b>Torturous Terrain</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; The adventure takes place in some sort of unsettled, uncivilized, dangerous terrain; in action stories, the desert and the jungle work best; choose one of those two or decide on a setting that is similarly dangerous and exotic. In this setting, the heroes have to contend with their villainous foes, yes, but they also have to deal with the inhabitants of the region, the monsters of the region, and the effort of just staying alive in a dangerous or unfamiliar climate. 
8,<b>Under the Ground</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; In this variety of adventure, the heroes descend into vast cavern networks beneath the Earth’s crust. There, they can encounter bizarre races and primitive tribes, hitherto-unknown monsters and strange landscapes. A good source for these adventures is presented in the DUNGEONEER’S SURVIVAL GUIDE’s chapters regarding the Underdark. This setting allows you to present the heroes with new encounters, and they may also need to find some way to escape the setting the exit door is not always clearly marked. 
9,<b>Under the Sea</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This sort of high-fantasy adventure takes place in and under (not on top of) the sea. The heroes require access to some sort of magic item or spell that allows them to breathe water for long stretches, and might adventure in the uncharted depths or perhaps in a community of sea-breathers. 

:SpecificSettings
1,<b>Catacombs</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; These can be catacombs beneath a living city or a ruined one. They can be long-forgotten or still in use. 
2,<b>Caves of Magical</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; Folk These can be either beautiful, glittering homes of gorgeous magical peoples, or the dank and terrifying lairs of horrible monsters. 
3,<b>Classic Dungeon</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This would be the standard monsterfilled labyrinth. Perhaps it’s a nesting ground for the master villain’s monster troops. 
4,<b>Craftsmen’s Chambers/Quarters</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This can occur in either the shop of the master craftsman of a palace or manor, or the guild-area of the city. 
5,<b>Demihuman Community</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; In wilderness areas, this will be a large community of demi-humans, elves, dwarves, halflings, whatever or intelligent nonhumans such as orcs. If your action is taking place in a city, this could be a hidden community (such as a secret underground dwarf community) or a section of the city inhabited mostly by demi-humans. 
6,<b>Laboratory</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This can be the alchemical lab of a friendly wizard, or the horrible experimental chamber of the villain where new monsters are created and released upon the world. 
7,<b>Legendary Forest</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This classic adventure site is the sometimes dark and fearsome, sometimes light and cheerful, always magical and incomprehensible forest inhabited by the oldest elven tribes and most terrifying monsters. 
8,<b>Lost City</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This is the remnant of some lost civilization or expedition, still thriving in some forgotten comer of the world. Remnants of lost civilizations can even inhabit cavern systems beneath campaign cities, preying on the aboveworlders for their goods, slaves, and sacrifices. 
9,<b>Madman’s Fortress</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This is the citadel of a major enemy. Strong, unassailable, filled with soldiers and monsters, lined with secret passages and deathtraps; not a wholesome place for adventurers to spend their time. 
10,<b>Magical Lake</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This is the aquatic equivalent of the Legendary Forest. Here beautiful and glistening, there treacherous and dangerous, filled with water-breathing magical folk. 
11,<b>Mansion of Powerful NPC</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This can be the home of a villain the characters may have to break in and rescue someone or steal evidence, or break out if they’ve been captured or of a heroic ally, in which case it may be used as the headquarters for the heroes’ plans and activities. 
12,<b>Military Encampment</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This is best used in an episode involving warfare. It could be the good-guy army’s encampment, from which the heroes launch their adventures, or the villains’ encampment, in which case the heroes might have to sneak in on a mission or escape from it if they’re captured. 
13,<b>Palace of the Ruler</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; The heroes could be here for many, many different reasons: Trying to get a favor from the ruler, part of some nobleman’s retinue, members of the palace guard, sneaking in to save the ruler from assassins, sneaking in to assassinate the ruler, thrown into the dungeon for crimes they did or didn’t commit, etc. 
14,<b>Ruins</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; These can be the ruins of some ancient civilization, an abandoned temple or castle, incomprehensible blocks of stone arranged by ancient gods, etc. They can be magical or normal, inhabited by ordinary animals or by monsters, centers of magic or just tumbled-down buildings. 
15,<b>Shacktown of the Oppressed</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; Part of the action centers around the tenements or shacks of the worst part of town; perhaps an allied NPC lives here or the characters are fugitives hiding out in the nasty part of town. 
16,<b>Tavern/Inn</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This is a classic fantasy setting, the residence of travelling heroes and the home of the tavern brawl. 
17,<b>Temple/Church</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This can be either the church of some lofty and good deity, or the dark and grisly temple of some horrid deity (doubtless filled with evil soldiers and monsters), or even the temple that the madman villain has dedicated to himself for when he becomes a god. 

:AlliesNeutrals
1,<b>Absent-Minded Expert</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; The characters find they need an expert in some field pottery, alchemy, whatever but all they can find is a somewhat daffy and absent-minded master of that subject. He’s useful when around his subject matter, but otherwise absent-minded, incautious, in frequent need of rescuing, etc. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Normal Man/Woman with appropriate skills. 
_<i>Character Hook:</i> [CharacterHooks].
2,<b>Arrogant Snob</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; For some reason, the heroes have to accompany or escort an arrogant nobleman or craftsmaster. They can’t afford to abandon or kill this person; he or she may be their employer, an expert on the place they’re going to, one of their relatives, or a relative of the royal family. And this person makes their life hell with sniping comments, haughtiness, and other unbearable traits. You can have this snob be unbearable all through the adventure, or gradually learn from the heroes the worth of “lesser persons;” perhaps that’s why this person was sent along with the heroes in the first place. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Normal Man/Woman with appropriate skills. 
_<i>Character Hook:</i> [CharacterHooks].
3,<b>Childhood Friend with a Dark Secret</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; One of the heroes is accompanied by one of his childhood friends... but said friend now has a Dark Secret. He does strange and mysterious things (sneaks off to send messages, or behaves strangely around certain NPCs, or is scared to death of certain harmless animals or situations) and will not explain why to his PC friend until late in the story. The Childhood Friend could now be a villain, or perhaps the master villain is blackmailing him to perform some action against the heroes, or he could be insane. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Experience level just below the characters’ party average. 
_<i>Character Hook:</i> [CharacterHooks].
4,<b>Congenial Madman</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This fellow is a pleasant, happy lunatic whom the heroes encounter; after the initial encounter, he follows them wherever they go, commenting on their plans, behaving strangely, getting underfoot, and very occasionally proving to be a real help. In reality, this fellow could actually be a madman, or a god in mortal guise, or a villain working for the master villain, or an agent for a friendly power helping the heroes. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Normal Man/Woman with no abilities to speak of; if a spy, has experience level equal to player-character party average; if a god, normal divine abilities. 
_<i>Character Hook:</i> [CharacterHooks].
5,<b>Crusty Old Professional</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; The heroes need an expert in a certain field. This time a craft or art, such as blacksmithing, engineering, horse-training, or whatever. The only or best professional they can find is an aged expert. He’s crusty, cranky, and sharp-tongued; he constantly complains about the food, the weather, his companions, the decline in skill of his co-workers since he was a young man, the road conditions, his working conditions, the rotten pay he’s receiving, and so on. You can have him actually possess a heart of gold or be just as nasty as he sounds. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Experience level just below characters’ party average. 
_<i>Character Hook:</i> [CharacterHooks].
6,<b>Gibbering Madman</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; Some poor wretch blundered into part of the master villain’s plan and saw too much. What he saw drove him crazy. He gibbers and jabbers, occasionally uttering clues about what he’s seen, but just isn’t coherent. He knows enough that the heroes will need to take him along to comment on what they’re encountering, though, so he can’t just be met and forgotten. This gives you an opportunity for some real wall-climbing role-playing as you portray this frayed-nerved, wideeyed human wreckage. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Normal Man/Woman with no abilities to speak of.
_<i>Character Hook:</i> [CharacterHooks].
7,<b>Government Observer</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; For some reason, the heroes’ ruler wants one of his own people accompanying them. It may be that the ruler has hired them for a task; it may be that they’re in trouble and have to be monitored; it may be that they’re so good at what they do that the ruler insists that the observer must accompany them to see how they do it. Whatever the reason, the heroes are now stuck with a haughty, selfimportant royal observer, an expert in (probably) military tactics or espionage. He continually offers unwanted advice (you can make it good advice if they need it, bad advice if it’s time for them to be captured or commit a blunder) and tends to get the heroes into trouble by pulling rank whenever he’s not satisfied. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Experience level equal to characters’ party average. 
_<i>Character Hook:</i> [CharacterHooks].
8,<b>Hero-worshipper</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; Some youth an urchin, a brother or sister of one of the heroes, or a child run away from home hooks up with the heroes, following them wherever they go, being admiring, talking to everyone (neutrals and villains included) about how wonderful and powerful the heroes are. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Normal Boy/Girl with no abilities to speak of. 
_<i>Character Hook:</i> [CharacterHooks].
9,<b>Ingenue in Distress</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; The heroes must protect some defenseless young innocent who is in danger from the villains. This person, perhaps the sheltered son or daughter of a nobleman or merchant, has no abilities at all but is sweet, charming, and in great need of help. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Normal Man/Woman with no abilities to speak of. 
_<i>Character Hook:</i> [CharacterHooks].
10,<b>Inquisitive Chronicler</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This character is a historian who wishes to accompany the heroes to record their exploits. He constantly pries into the heroes’ backgrounds, asking questions that are none of his business, as the adventure continues. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Experience level half that of party average; excellent scribe and writer. 
_<i>Character Hook:</i> [CharacterHooks].
11,<b>Merry Minstrel</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This character follows the heroes in order that he might find inspiration for his song and storytelling. He can’t be shut up; he sings all the day long and into the night, is a showoff before crowds, and is far too noisy for a party trying to remain unobserved. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Experience level half that of party average; fine minstrel abilities. 
_<i>Character Hook:</i> [CharacterHooks].
12,<b>Obsequious Merchant</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This fellow is the owner of the caravan the heroes are protecting, or the merchant the heroes encounter when they desperately need to buy something. He is oily, ever-flattering, overly agreeable, and is a sharp bargainer; the heroes will not find him willing to give them a sale price. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Normal Man/Woman with bargaining ability and a certain amount of wealth. 
_<i>Character Hook:</i> [CharacterHooks].
13,<b>Romantic Loony</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; Somewhere, the heroes bump into a lunatic who falls immediately in love with a player-character and won’t leave him or her alone. This character may be a love-smitten village lass or nebbishy adventurer. Whatever the origin, this character must be hopelessly in love with the character but have some trait which keeps the character from reciprocating; perhaps the loony is too plain, too crazed, or too stupid. Whatever, he or she really is sincere in his affection for the character. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Experience level at one-half party average or at party average.

14,<b>Talkative Barkeep</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This classic encounter is the garrulous innkeeper who has information the characters want. Trouble is, they’ll have to bribe him to get it, or agree to stay at his inn, or buy a lavish meal, or listen to his incessant stories about his career in the army, or whatever.

15,<b>Tragic Fellow Hero</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; The heroes are in the company of some hero well-known to them. He may have been a companion or ally, or they may just know him by reputation. He is a tragic figure; he may have lost his family to the master villain, or lost his properties and titles, or be afflicted with a curse he cannot be rid of, or be committed to a quest he knows will take his life. He’s dour, and gloomy, prophesying doom and having no fun at all.

16,<b>Villain Ally</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; For some reason, the heroes find themselves in the company of a villain. Perhaps he’s a minion of this adventure’s master villain; he may be guiding the heroes to wherever they must leave a ransom, or, if the master villain is forcing the heroes to perform some mission, this villain ally is along to make sure they do it right. Whatever the reason, he’s competent, unpredictable, and out for himself.

:MasterVillians
1,<b>The Agent Provocateur</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This Master Villain is a clever spy who infiltrates an organization, order, or army, and tries to effect its destruction by getting it to perform actions which will cause others to oppose it directly. For instance, he might join a church order, then begin promoting the least-appealing philosophies held by the church say, racism. By promoting the church’s racist philosophies, he can bring the church in direct opposition to other races, leading to armed conflict, chaos, and the downfall of that order, all while pretending to be a good member of the order. The identity of this Master Villain is usually a closely-guarded secret; the heroes will encounter his cover identity, but will not suspect that he’s responsible for all this chaos until they start adding up clues. Females in this role can be very, very effective. This Villain is best used for espionage and mystery adventures. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Experience level around that of party average; character uses brains more than combat ability; often is of thief or related profession. 
2,<b>The Advance Agent</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This villain is the vanguard of some sort of invasion; often, he is trying to open up a portal to a dimension full of trapped demons and evil gods. He is best used for horror or espionage adventures. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Experience level significantly higher than player-characters’ average; often a magic-user or cleric. The Avenger This villain seeks to avenge some wrong he thinks he’s suffered. He may be right: he may have suffered a wrong, and this makes him a little more sympathetic than villains who are purely evil. 
3,<b>The Avenger</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;uses his organization thugs and bribed officials to get at the one who wronged him, and will want either to duel (singly) the one who wronged him, or to put the wrongdoer in a deathtrap. He is best used for mystery and revenge adventures; he is less suited to comedy and romance adventures. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Experience level similar to that of the party average (or, if the one who did him wrong is a PC, of that character); profession similar to that of the one who did him wrong. He uses many minions until his final confrontation with the one he hates. 
4,<b>The Conqueror</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This character is moving his army in to take over; that’s what he lives for. He’s been the enemy of your characters’ nation’s ruler, and has launched a fullscale invasion of your characters’ favorite nation. The heroes have to beat their way through or elude his hordes of soldiers in order to get at him; better yet, they might lead their own nation’s troops against his and outthink him in military fashion. Obviously, this fellow is best-used for wartime and action/adventure scenarios; espionage scenarios (reconnaissance behind enemy lines) also work well with him. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Experience level at least the party average; probably belongs to one of the fighting character classes. 
5,<b>The Corruptor</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Corruptor is the villain who wants to make something nasty out of something that is currently nice. He may be working on a small scale i.e., wish to corrupt one character or a few characters, particularly PCs and their favorite NPCs. Alternatively, he may be a big-scale villain trying to change an entire city or nation into a jaded, debased pit of sin, hatred and death. This character is best used for horror adventures; he also works very well for revenge melodramas (if he has already corrupted someone or some place dear to the player-characters).
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Often, an evil god or demon, particularly one skilled at magic, is very appropriate for this role; in this case, the heroes will probably not be striving to kill him, which might be impossible, but to thwart his latest plan. If the Corruptor is a human or demi-human, he should be a powerful magic-user several experience levels above the player-character average. In any case, he should have hordes of minions or some spectacular magic that helps him corrupt the righteous.
6,<b>The Destroyer</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This villain is like the Corruptor, except that he likes destroying instead of corrupting. He operates like the Conquerer, moving in his armies often nonhuman or monstrous armies and destroying everything in sight. Again, the Destroyer could easily be an evil god or demon, meaning the heroes will have to find his weakness in order to thwart his current plan.
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Often, an evil god or demon, particularly one skilled at magic, is very appropriate for this role; in this case, the heroes will probably not be striving to kill him, which might be impossible, but to thwart his latest plan. If the Corruptor is a human or demi-human, he should be a powerful magic-user several experience levels above the player-character average. In any case, he should have hordes of minions or some spectacular magic that helps him corrupt the righteous. 
7,<b>The God of Chance</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Here you have two options. This Master Villain could be a real entity an actual god of mischief or silliness, who has intruded in the heroes’ lives to cause chaos and have fun. Alternatively, this “villain” could actually be pure chance: The heroes are having a series of unrelated, accidental encounters which cause them fits. No real single villain is involved, although initially it looks as though there is. This villain is best used for comedy and romance adventures, and is appropriate for most of the other types except horror and revenge. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>If a god, godly abilities; otherwise no level or abilities, just powerful coincidence. 
8,<b>The Lovable Rogue</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This Master Villain isn’t really evil he’s just chaotic and fun. Cheerful bandits in the forest who rob from the rich to give to the poor, singing and ropeswinging pirate kings, and romantic, sophisticated duellists all belong to the category of the Lovable Rogue. Often, the Rogue will not be behind the nastiness the heroes are encountering; he may be in competition with them for the prize they’re seeking. Often, the heroes and the Rogue (and his minions) will have to team up to succeed at their task. Just as often, the Rogue will try to get away with the whole treasure. The Rogue is best used in action/ adventure, comedy, and romance adventures, but is fit for just about every sort of scenario.
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Experience level similar to player-character party average; probably belongs to fighter, thief, or related character class. He usually has a hardy band of adventurers (ranging from one-third to onehalf his experience level) devoted to him and working with him. 
9,<b>The Organizer</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This Master Villain is the head of the local criminal syndicate the Thieves’ Guild or slaver ring, for instance. He’s cold-hearted and unsympathetic, and human life means nothing to him. He employs assassins and musclemen against the heroes, and can only be reasoned with when it’s going to profit him more to cooperate with the heroes than kill them. The Organizer is best used in mystery, espionage, and revenge episodes, particularly those with a gangland flavor. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Very low experience level he uses brains and hoods, not his own muscles. 
10,<b>The Ravager</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This Master Villain is like the Destroyer, except that he terrorizes a very limited area such as a village, island, castle, or clan stronghold. (He may want to destroy the whole world but be trapped where he is; perhaps his efforts to free himself constitute the adventure’s plot.) He stays in his area and terrorizes whatever comes in to it. This villain is best used for action/ adventure, mystery, and horror scenarios. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Varies. He could be a human or demi-human, or a monster. Structure him and his followers so that, together, they are more than a match for the heroes, but he alone is not as powerful as the heroes all together. 
11,<b>The Sufferer</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This Master Villain disguises himself as some other sort of villain. Long ago, he was given an ugly curse he longs for death but can never die unless slain by heroes unaware of his curse. (Naturally, the way the curse works, he has to defend himself when attacked by the heroes.) So this villain works hard to make sure the best heroes in the world have sufficient cause to want to come and kill him. He’ll insult them, ruin them, kidnap or murder their loved ones, whatever it takes to bring them against him. Often, he can only die his curse can only be undone in one specific holy place, so he’ll have to lure the heroes to that place to face him. If the heroes are doing research on the villain all this time, they may find out his secret, leading to a sad and painful end to the episode as the unkillable villain has to leave and find someone new to kill him. Obviously, this villain works best in serious adventures, especially straight action/adventure, horror, mystery (Who Is This and Why Is He Doing These Things?) and revenge. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>This villain should have fighting ability as great as that of the best fighter in the party, and may have magic and minions as well but he cannot be killed by mortal hands except under the circumstances as indicated above. 
12,<b>The Zealot</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This villain is like the Conquerer, but he’s not trying to conquer to own; he’s trying to purge the world of something he feels is pure evil (another religion, a human, demi-human, or nonhuman race of sentient beings, a custom). He operates just like the Conquerer, enslaving or killing all those who belong to the “wrong” race or philosophy. Adventures against him are similar to those of the Conquerer; it’s only his own goals that are different. Warfare, revenge, action/adventure, and espionage are all very appropriate scenario types. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Just like those of the Conquerer. 

:!MinorVillians
1,<b>The Avenger</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This character is much like the Master Villain of the same name, but he’s not in charge of all this villainy, and he’s definitely an enemy of one of the player-characters. You’ll have to decide who he is and why he hates one of the heroes; he could be anything from a recurring villain to someone who simply lost a fight to the hero once. The Avenger works mostly in the field, bedeviling the heroes as they seek out the Master Villain; he can be slain earlier in the adventure, but otherwise ends up fighting the hero he hates in the adventure’s climax. The Avenger can seldom be converted to the heroes.
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>The Avenger is usually a fighter or of a cause. related character class, and of an experience level similar to that of the best fighter in the players’ group. 
2,<b>The Chief Assassin</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Chief Assassin is the favorite killer of the Master Villain. The Assassin works mostly in the field, first killing witnesses who might prove harmful to his master, then zeroing in on the player-characters. He usually meets his end before the adventure’s climax, but he may take one of the heroes down with him. The Assassin can seldom be converted over to the heroes’ cause; he has no respect for life, and likes killing too much. He will flee if he sees his master killed. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>This villain is usually a thief or assassin at about the average level of the playercharacters’ party; he may be a monster instead. 
3,<b>Childhood Friend with a Dark Secret</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This Minor Villain is like the character of the same name from the Allies and Neutrals section. However, the heroes find out early on that he’s really working for the Master Villain. He may not wish to be helping the villains; his family may be held hostage, or he may just be too frightened of the villain or otherwise weak-willed to refuse. Alternatively, he could actually be evil now. This villain usually pals around with the heroes in the early part of the adventure, then steals something important from them or otherwise harms them and scurries home to his master. He’s encountered again just before or during the adventure’s Climax, where (of course) he must fight his childhood friend, the player-character hero. This villain can often be converted to the heroes’ cause; after all, he is an old friend of one of them. But the decision usually costs him his life, as the Master 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>ExpeVillain shoots him in the back for his rience level similar to the average level in the PCs’ party; this character is usutreachery. ally a simple fighter. 
4,<b>The Corrupted Hero</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This villain was once a hero, possibly one known to the players. He was seduced by the dark side of the dungeon master. Because of his own weakness, or of a curse, he has become a villain, a pawn of the Master Villain. Usually, the heroes encounter him once or twice, long before reaching the adventure’s climax, and have inconclusive fights with him; it’s best when he can duel one hero who recognizes him, then can get away to safety. It may be that he is now committed to evil; it may be that he’s ambivalent. If the latter is the case, then he, like the Childhood Friend, will have a big choice to make when the story’s climax comes around. If he chooses for the heroes, then he, too, is likely to be killed for his trouble. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Same character class and approximately the same experience level as any one of the more powerful party members especially the one most likely to have heard of him or be a friend of his. 
5,<b>The Coward</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This character is an ordinary grunt minion of the Master Villain, but he’s a coward. He’s deathly afraid of the Villain and the heroes. He’s best used when you plan to have the heroes captured; by his mannerisms, you can make it clear to them that this fellow is a coward and they will begin to work on him psychologically. He can’t be converted to the heroes’ way of thinking he’s too afraid but can be convinced to help them if they persuade him that he will be absolutely safe from the Master Villain’s retribution. Of course, he probably won’t be. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Usually a fighter several levels below the.PC party’s average level. 
6,<b>The Hard-eyed Advisor</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is the sort of villain whom the heroes see in the Master Villain’s throne room. He’s hard-eyed and scary; life means nothing to him and he enjoys killing. He’s also a good advisor to his master. He can’t be converted to the heroes’ way of thinking. He likes what he does too much. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>This villain is usually a magic-user or cleric at an experience level close to that of the most powerful player-characters. He’s tricky and probably has some magical items to boost his combat abilities. 
7,<b>The Inquisitor</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This villain is the one who interrogates the heroes and the NPCs captured by the villains. He accompanies the other Minor Villain out into the field and works on anyone captured; he enjoys inflicting pain and suffering. He, too, can’t be converted to the heroes’ way of thinking. He likes what he does too much. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>This villain is usually an assassin at an experience level close to that of the most powerful player-characters. He’s a sneaky fighter, perhaps with magical weapons. 
8,<b>The Lovable Rogue</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This character is like the Master Villain of the same name, except that he has no minions of his own and serves at someone else’s bidding. However, he’s very independent, not always working in his employer’s best interests; he often makes fun of the Master Villain’s pretensions and may suffer that villain’s retaliation because of it. It’s possible to convert the Rogue to the heroes’ cause; if they offer him money, action, adventure, a pardon for past crimes, or even if there’s an attractive PC of the opposite sex who appeals to him, he may be tempted over to their side. If he isn’t, he’ll abandon his employer during the climax, escaping to safety. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>The Rogue is probably a fighter or thief at a level similar to the average playercharacter level. 
9,<b>The Misguided Moralist</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This fellow has been convinced that only by helping the villain achieve the Master Plan can he improve the world. He tends to be encountered all through the adventure’s plot, usually escaping from the heroes and taunting them for their wrong thinking. Fortunately, he’s no more effective as a villain than he is as a thinker. It’s very hard to convert him to the heroes’ cause; he’s too wrapped up in his own cause. It can be done, however, if the heroes can demonstrate that the Master Villain has, say, lied to him. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>This character is usually a fighter or cleric a few levels less experienced than the average player-character. 
10,<b>The Mistress or Daughter with a Heart of Gold</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This character is much like the “Lover of Daughter of Villain” type of Mystery Woman (from the “Story Hooks” pages). In this case, she usually accompanies the Master Villain, but sometimes goes on missions of her own, where she runs into and develops affection for one of the player-characters. This sort of Minor Villain is easiest to convert to the heroes’ cause, but, especially if she’s not the villain’s daughter, she may suffer his wrath at the story’s climax, when he finds out she has been helping his foes. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Probably a thief or magic-user at experience level one-half the party level. 
11,<b>The Moronic Muscleman</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This fellow is a huge, powerful monster of a fighter. His job is to smash anything the villain tells him to smash. He does that very well, but don’t ask him to do any thinking; he has no time for such brainy stuff. He cannot be converted to the heroes’ cause; he has a blind, unswerving, perhaps magicinduced loyalty to his master. The Moronic Muscleman doesn’t have to be human. He can be a zombie, a golem, an animated statue, or some horrible manlike creature. He is encountered in the field, usually as the servant of the adventure’s other minor villain; if he survives, he is usually on hand at the adventure’s climax. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Experience level equal to or just over the party average; incredible strength. 
12,<b>The Single-minded Soldier</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This most trustworthy of villain minions is the experienced, competent, persistent soldier a field-trained officer who serves the villain with military precision. He is usually encountered in the field as leader of the villain’s field operations. He is not encountered directly until the middle of or the latter part of the adventure; until then, the heroes encounter only his subordinates. It’s very hard to convert the soldier to the heroes’ cause; he usually doesn’t have any conscience worth mentioning. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Usually a fighter equal in experience to the party average; has superior planning abilities. 
13,<b>The Snivelling Vizier</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Vizier is a throne-room villain. Functionally, he’s rather like the HardEyed Advisor, offering tactics and advise to his master; but he’s an oily, sleazy, cowardly sycophant. He’s usually brilliant in his field of advice but has no combat abilities. He cannot be converted to any heroic cause, but can be convinced to abandon or betray his master in order to save his own hide. This is best done when the heroes break into the master villain’s throne room; the vizier would have to muster up a lot of courage to confront them. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Usually a Normal Man/Woman with no abilities to speak of, other than planning abilities and political influence. 

:Plot
1,<b>The A-B-C Quest</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is an epic sort of plot. In it, the heroes are given (or undertake) a task to perform: The taking of a city, the rescue of an innocent, the destruction of a monster, the creation of a magical item, the defeat of the Master Villain, etc. But the path to victory is not a simple one. To get to their goal, Event A, they find that they must first accomplish some other task Event B. But when they undertake the task of accomplishing Event B, they find they must first accomplish Event C. This goes on for several encounters, until the heroes accomplish all the obstacle events which prevent them from returning to Event A, their original goal. For instance, the heroes decide that they must attack and destroy the demon Hashkoreth in his mountaintop stronghold. But legend has it that Hashkoreth can only be defeated by the sword forged for this task, and that sword was thrown ages ago into the Gorge of Doom. At the Gorge of Doom, the heroes find that they can only descend if they wear special armor forged by dwarf-kings several centuries ago. When they confront the current dwarf-king, he says he will give them the armor only if they defeat the great dragon which is ravaging his land. And so on. This plotline is best for Action/ Adventure, Comedy, and Horror adventures, but works for most other types. It works best when the Master Villain is an Advance Agent, Corruptor, Organizer, or Sufferer someone who can stay put and wait for the heroes to arrive at his stronghold. 
2,<b>The Accumulation of Elements</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;In this sort of plot, the heroes have to go from place to place perhaps covering very little area like a city, perhaps roaming the known world and accumulate elements to be used against the Master Villain. These elements may be Clues (revealing the identity of the Villain), Pieces of an Artifact (the one which can destroy the Villain), Evidence (which will persuade someone to act against the Master Villain), or Allies (which will allow the heroes to win their war). This plot works best when the villain is an Advance Agent, Corruptor, Organizer, or Sufferer, for the same reasons as in “The A-B-C Quest,” or the Agent Provocateur (clues reveal his identity and purpose), or the Conquerer, Destroyer, or Zealot (assemble allies to defeat his army). 
3,<b>The Event</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;For this plot, choose some sort of event a tournament, a holiday, a celebration called by the king, a masked ball, or whatever and set the commencement of the Master Villain’s plan against that backdrop. For instance, let’s say that the Master Villain is the Organizer that is, a crime boss. Obviously, he’s picked this event as the time for some important crime: the assassination of a noble or theft of some immense treasure, for instance. You contrive to have the heroes present at the event; you go through one or two of the event’s incidents (duels at a tournament, for instance); and then the master plan gets under way and the characters begin seeing clues to alert them that something is wrong. The event continues as they investigate; it provides an interesting backdrop to their activities. With luck, the heroes will put together enough clues to discover what’s afoot and thwart the plan. This plot works best for villains with subtle plans, like the Agent Provocateur, Advance Agent, Avenger, Corruptor, and Organizer. 
4,<b>The Geographic Progression</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is the simplest sort of adventure plot. The heroes have an area to investigate or travel through; they have encounters based on where they are. For instance, the traditional dungeon, where monsters are tied to specific rooms or areas. Or, if the heroes are travelling along a narrow valley or through an enchanted forest, they might suffer ambushes and other encounters fixed to various points along their travel plan. The plot, then, is getting to the villain by surviving the intervening obstacle encounters. This plot works best with the same villains as the A-B-C Quest. 
5,<b>The Series of Villains</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is a very dramatic plot, and very well-suited to oriental campaigns. In it, the heroes have undertaken a quest, usually the finding and defeat of the Master Villain. They may have to travel to his citadel, or head off in another direction to find som’e artifact capable of defeating him, or run away from pursuing villains until they can figure out what’s going on. All along their route, they are set upon by villains each villain has a name and distinct persona&y, and each encounter is life-or-death for the heroes and villains; the villain never escapes to safety if the tide turns against him, he fights unto death. The adventure becomes a war of attrition; the villains gradually wear down the heroes, perhaps killing some of them, as the heroes go about their quest. By the time the heroes reach their enemy, there is no doubt that one side or the other will utterly perish. This is a type of plot not suited to happy-go-lucky campaigns or villains.

:Climax
1,<b>Bloody Battle</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is the best Climax for an adventure involving the clash of mighty armies or for any adventure where, toward the end, the Master Villain and a large body of minions confront the heroes and their own troops. This finale is characterized by a monstrous clash between the two forces, with the heroes chewing through the enemy ranks to get at the Master Villain and his elite guards. It’s strenuous, exciting, and classically simple. 
2,<b>Chase to Ground</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;First, you have Heroes Chasing the Villain. The villain, after a series of encounters with the heroes, is running to safety, to some place where he can acquire more power, or to somewhere he can accomplish some dread purpose such as assassination or mass murder. The heroes chase him, have to deal with the obstacles he leaves behind, and finally catch up to him before or just as he reaches his goal. Here, we have the final duel between the villain’s forces and the heroes. Second, you have the Villain Chasing the Heroes. Often, in a story like this, the heroes have found out how to defeat the villain such as getting to a particular temple and conducting a particular ritual. The villain chases them all through their quest, catching up to them just as they’re commencing their ritual; they must, with heroic effort, conclude the ritual while suffering his attacks. Third, you have the Master Villain’s Sudden Escape Attempt. This takes place in adventures where the Master Villain’s identity is unknown until the end. His identity is revealed and he makes a sudden bolt for freedom; the heroes give chase. This usually results in a dangerous foot-chase through nasty terrain such as across rooftops, through the dungeons, or across an active battlefield. 
3,<b>Divine Retribution</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Here, the heroes’ goal has been to alert the gods that the Master Villain threatens them or their plans; in the last scenes of the adventure, as our heroes face an overwhelming enemy force, the gods bring down their divine retribution on the villain, causing a massive earthquake, tidal wave, lightning storm, or flood of monsters. This is all well and good, but the heroes are too close and must escape the fringe effects of this awesome disaster. A variant on this is the Natural Disaster. No gods are actually involved, but the Master Villain has been tampering with delicate forces of nature. He may, for instance, have been powering his master spell with the energies of a volcano. When the heroes attack the scene of his spellcasting, the spell goes out of control and so does the volcano. The villain is consumed in the eruption and the heroes must escape or be consumed themselves. 
4,<b>Prevented Deed</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Here, the heroes have been defeated captured by the Master Villain, or so thoroughly cut up by his minions that all believe them to be dead. And the heroes have learned, from the bragging of the villain, loose talk of his minions, or examination of clues, what is the crucial event of his master plan. In any case, the battered and bruised heroes must race to this site and have their final confrontation with the villain, bursting in on him and his minions just as the knife or final word or key is poised, and prevent the awful deed from taking place and, incidentally, defeat the master villain and minions who beat them previously. 
5,<b>Scattered Duels</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;In this climax, the heroes have gotten to the end of their quest they may have broken into, sneaked into, or escaped from imprisonment within the villain’s citadel, or have marched into the little town where the villain is holed up and they become separated. You can separate them by having traps and tricks break the party apart, by having them see two or three things they must resolve (such as danger to innocents or the appearance of minion villains) pop up simultaneously; they’ll have to run in all directions at the same time or suffer failure. Once the party is broken down into bite-sized chunks, you confront each individual or small group with the enemy or enemies he most deserves to face his personal enemy, the monster which defeated him before, etc. for a grand series of climactic duels. This works best when the Master Villain is one which can be duelled; if he’s a demon or god, the heroes may need an artifact to fight him. 
6,<b>Throne-room Duel</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is set up much like the Scattered Duels, except that you don’t separate the heroes. It’s harder to control whom fights who in this situation... but if it doesn’t matter who has the final duel with the Master Villain, this is a classic climax choice. 

:MonsterEncounters
1,<b>Assassin-Beast</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This monster, at some time in the adventure, is sent by the Master Villain to attack one or more heroes when they’re at their most vulnerable asleep, enjoying themselves, etc. Usually, the AssassinBeast attacks, but the hero, though injured, is able to hold it off long enough for his friends to respond to his shouts. The Assassin-Beast is usually killed by his friends, who can then speculate on who sent it and why. Obviously, the Assassin-Beast is not a good choice if the Master Villain is unlikely to employ it: the God of Chance and the Lovable Rogue, for instance. 
_<br><i>Good Monster Choices: </i> Aerial Servant, Demons Type I-VI, Lesser and Greater Devils, Djinn, Efreet, Gargoyle, Golems, Harpy, Invisible Stalker, Rakshasa . 
2,<b>Beast Amok</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Some time when the heroes are in a village or city, an animal, probably an otherwise tame or captured beast, is set loose by the villain’s minions or driven mad by the Master Villain. The beast goes berserk in the crowds; if the heroes aren’t inclined to capture or kill it, it goes after them. In ocean-going vessels, this beast could be caged trade goods en route to a foreign port. 
_<br><i>Good Monster Choices: </i> Ape, Babboon, Bear, Giant Beetle, Boar, Bull, Dragon (Baby), Flightless Bird, Giant Porcupine. 
3,<b>Foreshadowing Monster</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;With this monster encounter, combat may not be necessary. This monster encounter exists to alert the characters to the fact that something unusual is going on, a foreshadowing of their upcoming conflicts with the Master Villain. 
_<br><i>Good Monster Choices: </i> Have the heroes stumble across an Assassin-Beast (from the list immediately above) just as he’s finished murdering some NPC who also opposed the Master Villain (perhaps someone they intended to enlist to their cause). Or, have the heroes encounter a Terrain Monster (below) which is not where it should be or not behaving as it should a bear driven out of the woods by the Master Villain’s monsters there now, for instance. 
4,<b>King Beast</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;At some point in their adventure, the heroes run across a King Beast some enormous, intelligent monster (which speaks the Common tongue) which is the leader of its species. Perhaps it needs help; if the heroes help it they’ll earn themselves a favor which the King Beast will repay at some later time in the adventure. Perhaps the heroes are in deadly danger and need help; the King Beast can be persuaded to help, but only in return for a deed or favor in the future. 
_<br><i>Good Monster Choices: </i> Centaur, Djinn, Dragon, Giant Eagle, Elephant, Griffon, Hippogriff, Ki-Rin, Lion, Minotaur, Giant Owl, Pegasus, Giant Ram, Treant, Unicorn, Whale. 
5,<b>Loving Deceiver</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;One of the player-characters, specifically one of the better-looking ones, attracts the attentions of a very attractive local of the opposite sex. This local person, encountered in unthreatening surroundings, invites the hero off to a liaison away from his friends and other people. Of course, this person is a humanappearing monster of some sort; once alone with the character, he/she will attack the character with monstrous intent. The hero may be able to fight off the monster; otherwise, you may wish to give his companions clues (such as comments by local residents who didn’t recognize the monster, who’d claimed to be a local) that their friend is in danger. 
_<br><i>Good Monster Choices: </i> Succubus, Type V Demon, Doppleganger, Jackalwere, certain very powerful Lamias who can shapechange, Vampire..
6,<b>Noble Beast</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;With this encounter, the heroes find that they have to capture but not injure some sort of powerful, noble beast in order to accomplish their mission. For instance, to reach a mountaintop aerie, they must capture pegasi and ride them up to their enemy. You’ll have to decide why the heroes must capture this sort of creature (i.e., what it is the monster can do for the characters that they can’t do for themselves) and choose a monster appropriate to that task. Then the heroes must themselves figure out how they are going to capture the beasts without harming them. Note that gods often enter the picture in these incidents sometimes against the heroes. Often, legend has it that these beasts are protected by the local god, so if the heroes hurt or kill the beast, they don’t just fail in their effort: they incur the wrath of the god in question. 
_<br><i>Good Monster Choices: </i> Dolphin (to get to undersea places fast), Dragon (to get to aerial sites, or into areas where only dragons may enter), Giant Eagle (to get to aerial sites), Griffon (to get to aerial sites or magical places where only griffons may go), Leprechaun (to get information about the lands of Faerie), Pegasus (to get to aerial sites), Sphinx (for its wisdom), Unicorn (to fulfill some magical spell). 
7,<b>Nocturnal Predator</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is a classic monster encounter: the arrival of a hungry carnivore in the middle of the night. Usually, this attack happens to heroes camping between villages or out in the deep wilderness: a wild animal, attracted by food odors (from the heroes’ campfire or from the heroes themselves) sneaks in for a bite. 
_<br><i>Good Monster Choices: </i> Anhkheg, Giant Ant, Carnivorous Ape, Bear, Giant Beetle, Black Pudding, Bugbear, Chimera, Dinosaur (Tyrannosaurus Rex), Gargoyle, Jackalwere, Lycanthrope (Weretiger, Werewolf), Peryton, Giant Snake, Giant Spider, Wolf, Wyvem, Yeti. 
8,<b>Powerful Tester</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is an unusual but potentially very dangerous monster encounter. Here, some powerful, intelligent monster with shapechanging ability turns into a human form. When the heroes encounter him, he is in need of help or having trouble. He may be having difficulty crossing a stream or carrying his load in to the village; he may be starving and in need of food; he may be harrassed by bullies; he may claim that his infant daughter has been taken away by slavers. In any case, he needs help, and obviously can’t reward the heroes for their help, and will only serve to slow the heroes down from their quest. If the heroes help him anyway, the Powerful Tester can do one of two things. He can reveal himself in his true form, announce that he is pleased with the heroes, and offer them aid some time in the future; all they have to do is shout his name or speak some chant and he will appear; he then leaves. Or, he can still pretend to be the beleaguered human, thank them mightily, and shuffle off out of sight; and, much later, when the heroes are in their time of gravest need, he shows up in his true form to help them. 
_<br><i>Good Monster Choices: </i> Couatl, Gold or Silver Dragon, Ki-Rin, Nymph, Pixie, Shedu, Sylph, Titan. 
9,<b>Ravager</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is another classic monster encounter: The monster which is bedeviling a community or local area and will continue to do so unless the heroes destroy or defeat it. Yes, this is similar to the Master Villain of the same name, but the Ravager usually has no master plan it just wants to kill, destroy, or eat. The Ravager ties into the plot in one of several ways: It may be one of many such monsters released by the Master Villain to damage local rulers; it may have been placed in the heroes’ path to slow them down; or it may be an unrelated event, but still affects the story because the heroes may kill it to earn the locals’ gratitude and help in their quest. 
_<br><i>Good Monster Choices: </i> Basilisk, Bulette, Chimera, Cockatrice, Dragon, Ghost, Giant, Gorgon, Jackalwere, Lamia, Leucrotta, Manticore, Owlbear, Peryton, Purple Worm, Spectre, Sphinx, Vampire. 
10,<b>Reconnaissance Monster</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;At some point in the adventure, the Master Villain will become aware of the heroes’ activities against him. If he has magical abilities or a magical servant, he will send some sort of quiet, clever monster to spy on the heroes. The heroes should have an opportunity to realize they’re being spied upon, leading them to a mad scramble as they try to capture or destroy the spy. 
_<br><i>Good Monster Choices: </i> Aerial Servant, Succubus, Djinn, Efreet, Homonculus, Imp, Pixie, Pseudo-Dragon, Quasit. 
11,<b>Stampede</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Should the heroes ever cross plains or prairies, their villainous enemies may wish to stampede a herd of large animals at them. Alternatively, beasts in the forest may be stampeded by fires set by the villains; in this case, it will not be one sort of animal charging through, but a mixture of terrified forest animals, from the smallest fox-cub to the largest bear. 
_<br><i>Good Monster Choices: </i> Buffalo, Bull, Cattle, Herd Animal, Horse, Mammoth, Mastodon. 
12,<b>Terrain Monster</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;And don’t forget the simple run-in with the animal belonging to the terrain where the heroes are: Every type of wilderness has its predators and big, nasty herbivores. 
_<br><i>Good Monster Choices: </i> (All) Spider, (Desert) Giant Scorpion, (Forest) Bear, Giant Beaver, Boar, Irish Deer, Giant Porcupine, Giant Skunk, Giant Stag, Wolf, (Jungle) Ape, Babboon, Jaguar, Leopard, Lion, Tiger, (Plains) Axe Beak, Flightless Bird, Hyena, Jackal, Lion, (Primeval Forest & Swamp) Dinosaur, (Seashore) Giant Crab, Giant Crayfish, (Swamp) Crocodile, Giant Frog, Hydra, Giant Lizard. 

:NPCEncounters
1,<b>Bandit Gang</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;When the heroes are en route from one place to another, have them run across one of the local bandit gangs. The bandits are faster and far more numerous than the heroes. Make it clear to the heroes that if they really have a fight to the finish with these bandits, all the heroes will surely die. But the bandits stay back. They swarm around the heroes, demonstrating their daring, but not attacking. Basically, they’re bandits who admire courage and prowess, and the bandit leader will challenge one or all of the heroes to some test of bravery or ability such as a horserace, a duel, a wrestling match, a joust, an arm-wrestling match where scorpions sting the loser, etc. If the heroes lose, they lose their horses or ship; if the heroes win, they win the bandit leader’s own horse (or treasure of some sort) and are free to go after they feast and celebrate with the bandits. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>The bandit who participates in the duel or trial should be a Fighter at his opponent’s experience level  
2,<b>Belligerent Soldier</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The belligerent one has just had his ears pinned back by his commanding officer and is anxious to take it out on some hapless civilian. If this is a city gate, he claims that the hero’s papers are wrong or that he recognizes the hero from descriptions of a wanted criminal; if this is the streets, he insults the hero’s lack of military bearing, pretty looks, clothes, smell, companion, or whatever it takes to provoke a reaction. Obviously, the belligerent one wants to fight, pound the hero into mash, and throw him into the jail for a day or two. If he defeats the hero, that’s precisely what happens. If the hero beats him, which is usually the case, you can have one of several things happen. If the hero kills him, or merely defeats him and then runs away without defending his actions to the authorities, the city guard or army will be out to capture the hero: Even if the killing was justified, the hero still has to stand trial to confirm this. If the hero doesn’t kill him, and stays to deal with the authorities, you may either have an intelligent and sympathetic officer agree with the hero (leading to the belligerent one’s losing rank and face see New Enemy, below) or have a hard-edge officer agree with his subordinate, leading to the heroes unfairly being pursued by the law. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Soldier might be a Fighter at just under the hero’s level, or might be a few levels higher. 
3,<b>Blackmailer</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;If the party is pulling a scam, this person knows it and can tell the potential victim; if they’re wanted by the authorities, he’s willing to alert the authorities that they’re here; if they’re hiding out from the Master Villain, he’s going to tell said villain that they’re here; he may have kidnapped one of their favorite NPCs and be holding him for ransom; and so on. But first, he sends a message to the heroes that he’s willing not to undertake this action if he’s given a substantial financial contribution. The heroes may wish just to pay the hush money in which case the blackmailer complains it’s not enough and blackmails them some more. The heroes may wish to give him the money and try to track him back to his lair, which can lead to a confrontation with this blackguard and his gang, or even the local Thieves’ Guild. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Any class, but probably Thief or Assassin, at half the average party level. 
4,<b>Bureaucrat</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Some time in their adventure, the heroes must deal with the local govemment and run into that most horrible of nuisance monsters, the bureaucrat and his red-tape dispenser. The heroes don’t have the right forms. When they have the right forms, they forgot to fill them out in triplicate. When they’ve gotten them filled out, they have to make an appointment. They wait for their appointment, and it is cancelled. They fill out new forms and make their second appointment, and the horrified bureaucrat informs them that they forgot to bring the “present” (bribe) duly required of visitors to His Exaltedness. And so on. Of course, if the players are savvy enough to bribe this fellow from the start, they’ll have no trouble at all. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Normal Man/Woman with no special abilities (except skill with Bureaucracy) to speak of. 
5,<b>Inquisitive Official</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Some local authority has noticed the characters’ presence and it makes her curious. She snoops around asking questions all the time. She may be a city guardsman or special agent of the ruler, but (functionally) she’s a police lieutenant, asking the wrong questions at the wrong time; the heroes have to work around her, sneaking where normally they’d be able to work in the open. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Can be a Normal Man/Woman with no special abilities to speak of, or can be up to heroes’ average party level and of any character class. 
6,<b>Lying Accuser</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;A captured thief may accuse the character of putting him up to the theft; an abandoned mother may accuse the hero of fathering her child; a reputable witness (working for the Master Villam) may accuse the hero of a murder or robbery. The hero shouldn’t know what he’s accused of until he’s hauled in by the authorities. The heroes may lose time proving their innocence, or may have to break the accused out of jail, which puts the authorities on their trail through the rest of the adventure. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Normal Man/Woman with no special abilities. 
7,<b>Old Friend at the Wrong Time</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;When the heroes are trying to sneak through a guardpost, citadel, or city where they can’t afford to be recognized, one of the characters’ old friends recognizes him and loudly renews their acquaintance in full view of the guards looking for the characters. This usually leads to an exciting chase as the heroes must escape. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Any. Mean Drunk The Mean Drunk works much like the Belligerent Soldier except that he’s not as tough, is of course drunk, and is usually accompanied by other Mean Drunks. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Fighter at half to one-third the heroes’ average experience level. 
8,<b>New Enemy</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;In the course of his ordinary activities, one of the heroes can make a New Enemy. Hurrying along the street, he can bump into a disagreeable fighter for whom an apology isn’t enough; in a tavern, he can make some innocuous remark that you deliberately have the irritable fellow misconstrue as an insult. The New Enemy will only exchange heated words with the hero at this point, but will appear again later in the adventure he could be a minion of the Master Villain or just coincidentally travelling along the heroes’ path and will eventually have to fight the hero. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Same class and level as the hero in question. 
9,<b>Press Gang</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This encounter works best with lowlevel heroes. In any port city, the heroes, in a tavem or hostel, may find themselves set upon by ruffians employed by the city; these ruffians use clubs and strike to subdue. If the heroes fight and beat the ruffians, they find themselves wanted by the law for assaulting officers of the peace. And if they fight and lose, they wake up to find themselves sailors, headed far away from their quest! Now they must decide whether they’re going to jump ship, mutiny, or just settle down to a few years of seafaring life. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Fighters, first to third level. 
10,<b>Seducer</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;One of the characters is invited to a romantic liaison with an attractive local. This local can be any one of several things: (1) He/she could just be interested in a brief tryst; (2) He/she could fall madly in love with the hero and follow the hero through the rest of the adventure; (3) He/she could be a “Loving Deceiver” from the “Monster Encounters” pages; (4) He/she could be a thief and rob the hero blind in the course of their liaison; (5) He/she could be a spy or assassin working for the Master Villain. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Varies with choices given above; usually Normal Man/Woman with no special abilities. 
11,<b>Thief</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;At some point in their adventure, the heroes have a run-in with thieves. Some sample encounters: (1) Walking along the streets, one hero is bumped into by a local, who apologizes. After a few more steps, the hero realizes his money-pouch has been lifted, and the thief who bumped into him takes off. This leads to a mad chase through the city streets, through the marketplace, across rooftops, through alleys and perhaps ambushers waiting there. Depending on how daring and aggressive they are, the heroes may or may not recover the money. (2) Returning to their inn from a hard day’s adventuring/investigating, the heroes walk in on a thief burglarizing their room. This thief, of course, hightails it out the window, leading to much the same situation. (3) The heroes return to their inn to find their rooms sacked and burglarized. The occupant of the next room got a good look at one of them, good enough for the heroes to be able to track him down; they must find him, catch him, force a confession from him, and find out where his allies are fencing the foods if they plan to get their property back. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Low (first to third) level thieves. 
12,<b>Truthful Accuser</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This encounter is like the Lying Accuser except that the accuser is telling the truth. Dig through your characters’ pasts, uncover a misdeed or two, and, when the heroes are at a critical point in their adventure, confront them with someone they actually have wronged. This person has found them and appealed to the sympathetic local authorities. The heroes will have to make good or have the authorities on their backs for some time to come. 
_<br><i>Character level and Abilities: </i>Normal Man/Woman with no special abilities. 

:TrapsDeathtraps
1,<b>Animal Pit</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is a classic trap of the adventure genre: The heroes (perhaps just one hero) are dropped into a pit filled with dangerous animals snakes, lions, bears, whatever. They must either fight the beasts or delay them until they can escape climb back out, open a secret door, break down a wall, have a rope lowered by friends above, etc. 
_<br><i>Plot Functions: </i>This is an explorer’s trap; it is sprung on heroes exploring an area they think is abandoned or where they think they are unobserved. Remember that the trap can be under observation; if some but not all of the heroes fall into the pit, the ones who remain above can be attacked by the villain’s minions. 
2,<b>Avalanche</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is an outdoors trap. Some time when the heroes are in a narrow canyon or gorge, or are on a snow-covered mountain, their enemies can arrange to dump an avalanche upon them (rocks and boulders in the first instance, snow in the second). It’s not enough merely to say “Make your saving throw vs. Death or be crushed/smothered.” Describe the scene to the heroes as they’re travelling along: They feel, rather than hear, the first groaning and trembling of the earth, then hear rocks begin to clatter down upon them/hear the great moaning roar of countless tons of snow beginning to slide down upon them; let them run madly for cover or to get off to the side of the avalanche slippage; just as they’re at the most critical stage of their running, just as they’re almost to safety and the slide is almost upon them, then you can have them make their saves, giving them bonuses if they’ve been clever or really exerted themselves, giving them minuses if they’ve played lackadaisically or just relied on high saving rolls to keep them alive. 
_<br><i>Plot Functions: </i>In the adventure, this is a situation where a single 0-level villain can come near to destroying much more deadly player-characters (make sure your characters realize this; perhaps they won‘t underestimate lowlevel villains again), and where all the sword-swinging ability in the world won’t save the heroes. It also serves to spice up otherwise-uneventful travelling. 
3,<b>Coliseum</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;If it’s appropriate, you can have the heroes captured by the local authorities particularly when they’re in an exotic land, lost world, or whatever and have them armed with gladiatorial gear and dropped into a coliseum for the entertainment of the locals. (Note that this works much better with fightingtype heroes than spellcasters.) The heroes may be forced to fight animals, monsters, hordes of criminals, or if you wish to be cruel each other. 
_<br><i>Plot Functions: </i>This situation has a lot of plot-related potential. If the heroes stay captured for a while, they can become popular gladiators, perhaps leaders of the gladiators, and may be able to lead a gladiator escape or even a revolt against the rulers. You can have one of the minor villains also be a prisoner/gladiator, and he and his personal player-character enemy can fight their final duel in the arena. Big fights in the coliseum are also an invitation for the arrival of Divine Retribution or Natural Disaster (see Climaxes). 
4,<b>Demolition Zone</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;In this classic deathtrap, the heroes are placed (usually bound and weaponless) in some building or area just as it’s due to be destroyed. Some examples: (1) Deep in a mine as it’s about to be flooded; (2) In a building at the bottom of a mountain as the villains are preparing to cause an avalanche to fall upon it; (3) In a building as it’s set afire and burned to the ground; (4) In a cursed temple as earthquakes are dragging it into the earth or toppling it from a clifftop; (5) In a sinking ship; (6) In a fort just as the final, sure-tobe-successful last attack by the enemy is beginning. 
_<br><i>Plot Functions: </i>Typically, the villains tie the heroes up, leaving them in this situation, and running off to escape the calamity. They seldom even look back; when they do, it’s usually from a great distance. What this means is that the heroes, if they escape, are given a great advantage: the villains may think that they are dead. The heroes have a little time to operate without villain intervention at least until the villains learn they’re still alive. 
5,<b>Framed</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;One or more of the heroes is accused and convicted of a capital crime one for which the mandatory punishment is death. (Note that this may be the result of the actions of the Lying Accuser from the “Character Encounters” pages.) The heroes must escape or die, and they’re escaping from the well-built,.well-protected prison of the local authorities. They may either follow the course of actions set out in the Escape writeup on the “Goals” page, or they may arrange for friends to break them out at the scene of their execution always an exciting and dangerous option, for there are guards and bloodthirsty crowds handy. 
_<br><i>Plot Functions: </i>This option serves to make the heroes wanted by the law; you don’t want to use this option if the heroes need the cooperation of the authorities to be successful in their quest. 
6,<b>Mutually Assured Destruction</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;In this very nasty deathtrap, the heroes are bound up in such a manner that any one of them may get free of his bonds but when he does, all his friends perish. For instance, the heroes are all placed in guillotines; the moment that one victim slides up the block pinioning his head, all the others lock in place and the blades drop. Obviously, the heroes’ task is to find some way for everyone to get out alive. Perhaps an intricate series of cooperative rope-cutting will defuse the trap; perhaps a coordinated maneuver will get everyone free as the trap is being sprung. Warning: Don’t use this type of trap unless everyone in it cares about everyone else in it! It’s an awful temptation for a callous character just to get himself free at the expense of all his companions. After all, once he’s free and they’re all dead, he can loot all their bodies and leave with all their best magical items. Do this only when all those trapped together are friends. 
_<br><i>Plot Functions: </i>This trap is an opportunity for the heroes to have to work together it’s best done when the heroes have been pursuing their individual initiatives too long and need to be reminded that they’re part of a team. 
7,<b>Pit and the Pendulum</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Actually, we’re applying this term to any of many time-delay deathtraps. In this sort of trap, the villains capture the heroes and place them in a trap which will soon kill them it operates on a delay, often based on a timing device or a burning fuse. Some sample traps include: (1) The Pendulum. This is the bladed pendulum which descends as it sweeps back and forth and will eventually cut the victim(s) in half; they must discover how to get free of their bonds, or block and stop the pendulum, or (most dangerously) use the swinging pendulum to get them free of their bonds. (2) Moving Walls. Here, the walls or ceiling of a room move to crush the heroes; perhaps they’re covered with spikes as well. The heroes must figure out how to slow down or stop the crushing walls, or must use their lockpicking skills to get out before they’re crushed, or must figure out how to position themselves in the room so that they won’t be killed before the room reaches its final compressed form. (3) Caged Animal Release. Here, the heroes are in a room adjacent to a cage which holds ravenous animals which will !Jl them; the heroes’ cage also holds L;le mechanism which will release the animals in just a few seconds or minutes. The heroes must figure out how to disarm the release mechanism before the animals are released. 
_<br><i>Plot Functions: </i>This type of trap is often used by the Master Villain just as he’s running off to the final stage of his plan. The heroes have not only to escape the trap but then immediately race to catch up to or intercept the villain. 
8,<b>Rock and a Hard Place</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This trap starts out as an Animal Pit, Pit and the Pendulum, or Tomb Deathtrap, but an obvious escape suggests itself very early on. If the characters are in an animal pit, for instance, there may be a dark hole in the pit at their chest level; it leads out of the pit. Trouble is, it leads into even worse danger. The hole out of the animal pit may lead to the lair of an even worse animal; it may lead through a succession of dangers (collapsing old catacombs, into an underground river, into a den of zombies) before the heroes reach the light. Sometimes the Master Villain knows about this dangerous escape path; usually, though, he doesn’t; it’s an out he didn’t know about and which is just coincidentally very dangerous. 
_<br><i>Plot Functions: </i>Same as that of the type of trap it is associated with. Stampede See the description of the 
9,<b>Stampede in the “Animal Encounters” pages.</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;
_<br><i>Plot Functions: </i>Same as for Avalanche. A zero-experience villain can harm or slay much more powerful heroes with this type of attack. 
10,<b>Tomb Deathtraps</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Another classic type of trap is the sort of triggered trap left behind in abandoned tombs, ruins, and catacombs. Here, a hero who touches the wrong step, floor tile, wall brick, torch bracket, mounted gemstone, or other device will trigger some sort of ancient trap designed to kill tomb-robbers and intruders. Popular varieties include rooms filling with water or grain, rooms closing for all eternity so that victims starve to death, sliding floors that drop heroes into animal pits (which may or may not be occupied after all this time), etc. It’s better to use traps which won’t kill heroes immediately, as spike-filled pits tend to do. Give them a chance to use their wits and abilities to escape; make it difficult enough that everyone who survives knows he had to struggle to do it, and those who didn’t survive know that it wasn’t a cakewalk. 
_<br><i>Plot Functions: </i>This type of trap serves to keep heroes on their toes in what would otherwise be very safeseeming abandoned areas. 

:!SpecialConditions
1,<b>Coping with a Curse</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The curse might be making the hero progressively uglier, might be draining out his life-force (he’s losing experience which will be returned if he succeeds), might be making him progressively insane. Each day, as he sees his reflection in a mirror or pond or fountain, he’ll know himself to be less than he used to be. 
2,<b>Magic Doesn’t Work Right</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;If the adventure is taking place on an alternate plane, then that plane’s magic works oddly or not at all. (A spellcaster will find that just making himself useful is a challenge when none of his spells works.) If the adventure takes place on your usual campaign world, then pick a site where this anomalous magical effect is taking place. It could be the temple of some unusual god, the site of an artifact, or the site of some ancient magical war. You can make some spells not work at all, while others are weakened and still others are stronger. Characters with no magic might now have spells, or may be utterly magic-resistant (don’t forget the villain). Characters might have to make a saving throw vs. Magic just to cast spells successfully. 
3,<b>No Hurting the Villain</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;For some reason, the heroes cannot afford to fight the villain directly. For instance, what if a demon possesses the body of the child of one of the characters, or a very important child spoken of in prophecy, one without whom the world will perish? 
4,<b>No Lawbreaking</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;For some reason, at one point in the story, the heroes cannot allow themselves to break the law even when it would help them greatly to do so. For instance, the heroes may be asking for the help of a king whose word is law and whose power is immense. When they arrive for their audience, an emissary of the Master Villain is making a similar plea for help. If the heroes attack and kill that emissary, they will lose any chance at the king’s help in fact, he may order their execution. Worse, the king decides to consider their requests and commands them to return in three days. In the meantime, they are not to harm one another. The heroes soon find that they’re being scrupulously watched, and the enemy emissary is continually taunting them, bragging that his request will be granted and theirs will not. He may even fabricate evidence to convince the heroes of this. The heroes’ life will be hell until the king decides and will certainly be hell if they decide to kill the enemy emissary. 
5,<b>No Weapons Allowed</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;At some point in the story, the heroes must surrender their weapons. Perhaps they’re visiting some,quarter of the city where weapons are not allowed; or a particularly peace-loving temple. In any case, once they’re there, they are attacked by enemies belonging to the Master Villain. If they have holdout weapons but don’t use them, they may perish at the hands of their enemies, while if they do use them, they earn the enmity of the local ruler or temple official. It’s a delicate situation. 
6,<b>Omnipresent Observer</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;If a wizard, demigod or god has forced the heroes to undertake this quest, he may be with them continually in spirit. He can’t help them, but does magically watch everything they do. And when they do something he doesn’t like, he tells them about it loudly and nastily. (This is distressing when they’re trying to break into a fortress or sneak through enemy lines.) This observer will be opposed to one or more of the heroes’ normal procedures (say, ambushing enemies; that’s dishonorable) and won’t let them get away with it, even though it might be efficient and make it more likely for them to succeed in their quest. 
7,<b>Stolen Identities</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This option requires that the Master Villain be of godlike power or possess some sort of artifact. Once the Master Villain realizes that the heroes are on his tail, he uses his powers or artifact and steals the heroes’ identities. One day they wake up and no one else knows who they are. They retain their memories of themselves and each other, but no one else does. (The villain knows them, though.) They can’t return to their estates; their families deny they are who they say they are and say that the heroes are adventuring abroad. Thus, they must complete the adventure without allies or resources beyond what they can beg, borrow, or steal from an uncaring world. 
8,<b>Time-limit</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Finally, the most obvious condition to place on an adventure is to give it a time limit. If the Master Villain is going to conclude his evil spell in only three days, and his citade! is three hard days’ riding away, then the heroes are going to be on the go all throughout the adventure with little time to rest, plan, gather allies, or anything except get to where they’re going.

:Misguidance
1,<b>Artifact That Doesn’t Work</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Often, epic quests against powerful Master Villains require that the heroes find some legendary artifact, the only object which can defeat the villain. If your heroes have had no trouble getting to that artifact they’ve effortlessly sliced through every obstacle you’ve put in their path and are confidently advancing on the resting place of the magical item you can have it not work. This is obvious as soon as the heroes lay hands upon it. It may be broken; magical analysis may indicate that all magic has been drained out of it; it may be lacking some essential parts or elements. And because of this, the heroes are not as far along as they thought. They’ll either have to find another mighty item to fulfill their mission, or will have to embark on another quest to find the essential elements to repair the artifact they have found. Caution: This is a cruel and unnecessary thing to do if the characters have really been working hard to attain their ends; it should only be done when the adventure has, so far, inexplicably been a cakewalk for them. 
2,<b>Extraneous Details</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;When giving the heroes details on their enemy for instance, details they are learning from investigations and readings you can give them just a few details too many. This may prompt the heroes to investigate the “extra” (i.e., irrelevant) details in addition to the relevant ones, thus losing them valuable time. Such irrelevant details might include: The place of the Master Villain’s birth (it turns out not to have any bearing at all on his current activities); The writings of the Master Villain or one of his Minor Villain minions (it turns out to be fascinating reading in the villain’s area of expertise, but has absolutely no bearing on the villain’s current activities.) 
3,<b>False Path to the Artifact</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Once again, if the heroes have had too easy a time finding the artifact capable of destroying the villain, give them trouble this way: When they get to the place where the artifact is supposed to be contained, they find the coffer or chamber or whatever empty, obviously looted by robbers, who have scrawled such remarks as “Kelrog Was Here!” upon the walls. The artifact could indeed have been stolen by this Kelrog person meaning the heroes will have to continue their quest to find it. Alternatively, this could be a clever ploy by the persons who originally hid the artifact. It might be in a chamber beneath the supposedly-looted (but actually never occupied) treasure chamber; the builders made it appear empty so that the first robbers on the scene would find it already looted. The heroes might not realize the scam until their investigations reveal that this Kelrog person lived centuries before the chamber was built or filled. 
4,<b>Loony Who Has It Wrong</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;You can have the heroes “aided” by a so-called expert who is actually a lunatic who doesn’t know anything about what he’s talking about. Once he’s led the heroes off to some remote part of the continent, his evasive answers and bizarre behavior will alert them that he really doesn’t know anything about what he’s pretended to be an expert on. 
5,<b>Lying Rumor</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is the worst and most useful type of red herring the interesting rumor which just happens to be false. In adventures of this sort, the best Lying Rumor concerns the Master Villain; it gives the heroes some “important” information about him which later turns out to be useless. Such rumors include: (1) Goal Incorrect. The rumor states that the Master Villain’s goal is one thing, when in fact it’s another. (2) Potential Ally No Longer Lives. The heroes hear about a potential ally who could be a big help. When they get to him, they find only his grave. (3) Species Incorrect. A clever Master Villain might leak false rumors about what sort of thing he is. A Pit Fiend might call himself the Vampire King, so that when the heroes break in with their sharpened stakes and holy water they are in for some confusion and disappointment. 

:OmensProphecies
1,<b>Birthmark Pertains</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;One of the heroes has a birthmark that pertains to the adventure in some way. He may have a birthmark identical to some NPC for instance, some person endangered by the Master Villain. This mystery can give the hero his reason to become involved. (Why do the characters have identical birthmarks? Either they’re related which a careful search of their mutual backgrounds might reveal or they’ve been so afflicted by some god in order that the hero help this other person which consultation with a high-level cleric can reveal.) Alternatively, his birthmark may mark him as a hero fulfilling some ancient prophecy see Hero Fulfills Prophecy, below. 
2,<b>Comet’s Progress</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Events during the adventure may be enlivened by a large and menacing comet which appears in the night sky for several days during the scenario; the locals take it for an omen of doom. The comet may be the result of magic being used by the Master Villain, in which case research by high-level wizards will reveal this; or, the comet’s appearance can pertain to an old legend involving the Master Villain. 
3,<b>Fortune-teller Predicts Doom</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is an ominous encounter: A fortune-teller predicts doom for one of the heroes, or for some community menaced by the Master Villain. If the heroes aren’t in the habit of consulting fortune-tellers, this mystic could stumble out of any crowd, pinpoint the hero he wishes to warn, issue his dire prophecies, and disappear back into the crowd. If caught or questioned, he can’t describe how he knows that doom is in the offing the cards told him, his (non-magical) crystal ball told him, he just knows. Shortly after, some calamity should befall the hero: He can be attacked by an assassin, be in a building when it is struck by fire or an earthquake, or suffer other danger. Investigation of the events can then point the heroes toward the Master Villain as the event’s instigator. The Villain may not have been deliberately targeting the hero; the hero’s involvement in the story may be purely accidental, as far as the Master Villain is concerned. 
4,<b>Hero Fulfills Prophecy</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is the most useful sort of prophecy. In the early part of the adventure, one of the heroes discovers that he fulfills some ancient prophecy. He might have stood on some famous landmark on the particular day of the year that a sunbeam shining through a nearby hole in the rock illuminated him for all to see. He may have arrived with his clothes and equipment arrayed in some fashion that had been long ago predicted by a seer; tie this in with the way the hero customarily dresses, or have an accident befall him so that he arrives in this condition (with one boot missing, for instance, or his top half spattered with mud while his bottom half is clean). You have to decide what the prophecy is. It may be that the hero is the only one who can defeat the Master Villain. It may be that the hero is supposed to kill the king (this becomes a selffulfilling prophecy when the king attacks or jails the heroes). It may be that the hero is the only one who can correct some old problem such as by awakening a long-sleeping princess with a kiss but that his action rouses the ire of the Master Villain. 
5,<b>Innocent Fulfills Prophecy</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Similarly, an innocent could fulfill a prophecy one which endangers his/ her life. This innocent might, for instance, be the one who is supposed to slay the king, but is not a mighty adventurer able to protect himself from the king; the heroes may find themselves sheltering and helping this poor dupe. 
6,<b>Reincarnation</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The hero, seeing the portrait of some long-dead nobleman, may be surprised to see his own face staring back at him. All evidence points to the fact that our hero is the reincarnation of this person, and the Master Villain may desire to destroy any trace of that nobleman’s existence. Just as appropriately, this long-dead nobleman may have died after making some important choice such as choosing love over career or career over friends; and the choice he faced is identical to one the hero now faces. Will our hero defy the prophecy and choose as he did in a previous life, or will he choose the other option and see what happens? 
7,<b>Totem Animal</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;If a hero has an animal which is his totem, he may see the animal engaged in a fight to the death with another animal one which, coincidentally, is the totem of one of the villains. How his totem defeats the other or is defeated by it gives the hero some clues as how to fight his actual opponent when the time comes.

:MoralQuandary
1,<b>The Ally Quandary</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;You set up the situation so that the heroes have a good chance at defeating the Master Villain if they get the aid of two specific individuals, probably experts in fields relating to the villains’ activities. But the two experts hate one another and refuse to work together, even if it costs them their world. Don’t let the heroes know that there is a problem until the two experts are brought together and realize that the heroes want them both. Then let the sparks fly with an NPC vs. NPC confrontation which includes namecalling directed at the heroes, who “should have known better than to drag in this flea-bitten pretender, this dastard with brains like gruel,” etc. The heroes are now in the position of having to choose between the two NPCs, who are equally vital. If you like, you can give them a chance to persuade the NPCs to work together but they have to put together one amazing argument to be successful. If they are not, the original dilemma is still with them. 
2,<b>The Friend Quandary</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;At a critical point in the story, one of the campaign’s NPCs makes an impossible demand of one of the heroes. What sort of demand? Here’s one favorite, the Lover’s Complaint: “I can’t stand you risking your life all the time... don’t go, stay with me, I need you. _ _ If you leave this time, I won’t be here when you get back.“ Another one, uttered by very underpowered NPCs just as the heroes are about to undertake the most dangerous part of the story, is something we can call the Nebbish’s Lament: “All my life, I haven’t been good enough.. . I’ve never succeeded at anything I’ve done... You’ve got to take me with you... I know it’s dangerous, but this is my last chance to prove myself.. .” 
3,<b>The Honor Quandary</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;You want to use this on the character with the most strongly developed sense of personal honor someone who has lived all his life by a strict code. Toward the end of the adventure, this character realizes that the best way to defeat the Master Villain is a violation of that code. For instance, the character might be a paladin, who discovers that the only possible way for the heroes to defeat the Master Villain is to sneak up on him and stab him in the back. A variation on this is when the character’s god suddenly becomes pragmatic and orders the character to perform actions which are outside the code of honor practiced by the character. When the stakes are big enough, as they are when dealing with the plans of very powerful Master Villains, gods may become fretful and order their favorite heroes to actions which the heroes oppose. Here, the hero faces not only the loss of honor but also, perhaps, punishment from his god. Caution: It is possible to ruin a character by utilizing this Quandary. If, at adventure’s end, the player feels that his character has been permanently dishonored, he may not wish to play the character any more. You can prevent this by making the honorable choice the better choice, or by providing means within the hero’s culture or order for the hero to do penance for his dishonor. 
4,<b>The Respect Quandary</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is much like the Ally Quandary, only at a greater distance. The heroes have been utilizing the aid of two (or more) powerful NPC allies. As an example, one is an old military man and the other is a wizard. Now, in the course of the adventure, the heroes come across a task which can be accomplished in one of two ways say, through military intervention or by esoteric magic. The heroes have to choose between these options, each of which seems equally viable. The problem is, the NPC allies are agitating for different choices, and the one whom the heroes choose against will no longer aid them. 
5,<b>The Saving Quandary</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Finally, another classic quandary puts the heroes in the position of choosing between a grand opportunity to hurt the Master Villain or saving the lives of a number of individuals. For instance, the heroes, sleeping in a small village while on the road in campaigns against the Master Villain, wake up one morning to hear two interesting things. A distant farmer has discovered that one of the most important Minor Villains and his men are encamped in a distant glade. If the heroes go there, attack and defeat him, they will score an important coup against the Master Villain. Trouble is, this farmer heard the Minor Villain discussing tomorrow’s attack on this village; another party of minions, led by a lessimportant Minor Villain, will be destroying this village today. The heroes can either travel to the site of the Minor Villain and strike a blow against the Master Villain, or stay here and weather the attack of the invaders. Caution: This is only good when the heroes actually care about the innocents in their charge. If they’re neutral, this is no quandary at all; they’ll attack

:Chase
1,<b>Aerial</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The heroes could be riding pegasi or friendly griffons or allied great eagles; the villains could be carried aloft by gargoyles or demons. The prospect of taking a mile-long fall if one’s mount is hit is a very daunting and challenging one for the hero. You could have the adventure involve the creation of some sort of magical airship: the heroes could be loaned an airship by wizards, or the villain could have created one. In the latter case, the Master Villain escapes in his ship, and the heroes must give pursuit on the backs of flying animals or perhaps using an earlier, smaller, cruder model of the ship. 
2,<b>Endurance</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Endurance Chase is not some sort of climactic chase it’s a rugged, tiring, persistent pursuit that tests the characters to their limits. In this chase, the heroes and villains are pursuing one another across a lot of territory and they’re not catching up with one another very fast. This may be a horseback pursuit across a hundred miles of Savannah, a camel chase across several days’ worth of desert, or a chase across arctic tundra. In any case, the chase is so rigorous that the heroes need to roll a save vs. poison every day (with CON modifiers to the roll) or lose l-4 hit points from exhaustion. The same may apply to their mounts if the heroes are pushing them too hard. 
3,<b>Footrace</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The chase involves the characters on foot, probably through such terrain as city streets or the corridors of a palace. One hero may realize that he’s being pursued by a party of enemies and choose to run for it; the heroes may have caught up to the Master Villain, prompting him to run for his life. If you want to spice up your footrace, lead it into some of the interesting places described in “Special Terrain,” below. 
4,<b>Horseback</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;This is a relatively short chase it only needs to go on for a mile or so before even the best horses are winded. If it goes on longer than that, the horses may collapse and perhaps die. Use whatever means you prefer to determine whether the pursuers catch up to the pursued. If the heroes are being chased, they may be able to use their own cleverness or knowledge of the area to elude capture. If the heroes are doing the pursuing, the same may apply: they might know a shortcut to head off the villams; alternatively, they may be better riders or have fresher horses. Don’t forget that when one party on horses catches up to another, the result may be a joust, another classic confrontation. If you want to spice up your horserace, lead it into some of the interesting places described in “Special Terrain,” below. 
5,<b>Special Terrain</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;You can make any chase more memorable by having it take place in a setting to which it is utterly unsuited. For instance, horse chases are fine and dramatic when they take place through the forest, out on the open plains, or along a road but they become diabolical when they take place inside the Royal Palace or in dangerous, labrynthine, treacherous catacombs. Catacombs. Have the heroes contend with poor lighting (characters without infrauision must carry their own torches), collapsing flooring (which injures them and deposits them in lower levels of the catacombs) and close encounters with catacombs dwellers. Inside a Building. Interesting to a foot race and very interesting with horse races; the heroes must contend with narrow hallways, furniture, the inhabitants, slick floors (too slick for horses), low-hanging chandeliers, and other problems. Rooftops. Footraces become very dangerous when one participant takes to the roofs; participants have to deal with jumps across alleyways, collapsing roofs, breaking slate rooftop tiles, sliding down a slanted roof and catching one’s self on the gutters or other projections, etc. Swamp. This classic choice for foot races and horse chases provides you with fetid pools filled with monsters, quicksand, will-o-the-wisp encounters, and consistently bad footing. Through the City. With the simple chase from one end of the city to the other (foot or horse), you get to put the racers through different types of neighborhoods (palatial estates, markets, slums) and the interesting color and inhabitants they provide. 
6,<b>Water</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Finally, don’t forget the water chase: Whether it’s a battle of seamanship between naval vessels, a chase of rafts toward the inevitable waterfall ahead, a contest of canoeing ability, or a chase between the villain and his giant shark vs. the heroes and their dolphin friends, the water chase can be a distinctive and dramatic one..

:SecretWeakness
1,<b>Element or Ingredient</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Master Villain can be banished, dispelled, killed, or otherwise defeated by some sort of element or ingredient: (1) A metal (gold, silver, iron); (2) A type of gemstone; (3) A specific plant (mistletoe, wolfsbane, red rose); (4) A common ingredient or element (sunlight, water, soil, leather). How this manifests itself: The Master Villain tries to get rid of all the examples of this element in his vicinity; he doesn’t let his minions carry it or bring it into his presence. But he’s not stupid; he doesn’t announce to the world what his weakness is. He tries to hide his concern within another command. If he’s allergic to red roses, for instance, he orders all “things of beauty” destroyed within miles of his abode. The heroes may find out what his specific weakness is from research (research which would not yield anything if they didn’t know about the peculiar behavior which conceals his weakness) or from bribing or interrogating Minor Villains close to the throne. 
2,<b>Holy Symbol</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The villain may have the traditional weakness to a specific holy symbol but don’t choose just an ordinary one. It may be a holy symbol no longer used by the church, or may be some forgotten variation on the current symbol. (For instance, the cross may not work, but a variation such as the Roman cross might; alternatively, it might have to be a holy symbol which has undergone some unfamiliar ritual.) How this manifests itself: The villain will be destroying the temples in which this holy symbol appears, but the heroes will not know precisely why unless they interview survivors of these raids and learn that the minions were very interested in destroying those specific symbols. Even so, you should give the heroes an early encounter with the Master Villain, so that when they flash the untreated or slightly-wrong symbol at him he can merely laugh at them. Then, they have to figure out why he’s worried about this symbol when it doesn’t hurt him. 
3,<b>Lack of Familiarity</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Master Villain, if he comes from the past or another dimension, or belongs to an alien race, might be sufficiently unfamiliar with this world that he essentially defeats himself. How? By making incorrect guesses about human behavior. One classic error involves underestimating the human capacity for self-sacrifice. For instance, when the heroes burst in on the villain’s throne room, they find him with an artifact which will enable him to complete his plans but can be disarmed if they all throw themselves into its deadly interior. When the villain realizes that they’re willing to do so, he’s already defeated; he’ll probably leave this plane in frustration before the heroes do kill themselves. How this manifests itself: All his minions will have noticed the villain’s odd interpretations; all the heroes have to do is capture (or convert) a Minor Villain and they’ll learn useful facts about the state of the Master Villain’s mind. 
4,<b>Love</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Master Villain possesses the “weakness” of genuine affection or love probably for some NPC, though it could be very intriguing if the object of his affections is a player-character. The heroes can then defeat the villain by holding his loved one hostage, or proving that his loved one will be seriously harmed, betrayed, or killed if the villain keeps up with his activity. How this manifests itself: If the loved one is one of his minions, the Master Villain may devote too many of his resources to rescue this person from capture or death, alerting the heroes to the fact that the relationship is different from what it seems to be. The villain may be keeping his loved one in great security in his citadel; an interrogated or talkative Minor Villain could talk about the area of the citadel no one but the Master may visit. When the heroes infiltrate the citadel, they’re sure to go there, meet the NPC in question, and discover the villain’s secret. 
5,<b>Secret Embarrassment</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Finally, the villain may have some aberration or secret shame that will force him to flee when he is confronted with it. It could be something as simple as the fact that his nose is too big, or that he is a small and nebbishy wizard pretending to be some vast, powerful demonic power. When his shame is revealed, he is too humiliated to continue; this is a good option for comedy adventures. How this manifests itself: Inevitably, this embarrassment is revealed when the heroes accidentally or purposefully see the true form of the Master Villain and realize that he is not like the paintings, images, and descriptions given of him in fact, he’s a lot less imposing. 

:CruelTricksComplications
1,<b>Heroes Must Work With Villain</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;If they have to work for the villain, it’s due to some hold he has over them probably, he’s kidnapped one of their NPCs and will kill this person if his demands aren’t met. Put the heroes through an encounter where they have to do something they are loathe to do, such as sack and pillage a temple, before they have the opportunity to retrieve their friend. If they have to work with the villain, it’s probably because an even worse villain has turned up! If you choose this option, roll on the Master Villain chart twice (and roll two Minor Villains for each Master). The less nasty Master Villain (i.e., the lesser of two evils) is the one who concocts the first Master Plot and first encounters the heroes. But halfway through the story, the second, nastier, Master Villain unveils his Master Plot, and the heroes and first villain must collaborate if they’re to survive. 
2,<b>Mission is a Ruse</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;In the course of their adventuring, the heroes discover they have been tricked into performing a mission which helps the Master Villain. For instance, the Master Villain might release rumors that a certain artifact is the only thing that can slay him. In truth, it’s his favorite weapon but only someone of pure heart can retrieve it from the lawful-good chamber where it is held. When the heroes recover it, the Master Villain swoops in and takes it, thanking them; the heroes are worse off than ever. 
3,<b>NPC turns Traitor</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;He may alert the enemy when the heroes are planning a raid; he may steal the artifact and take it to the villain; he may stab a hero or important NPC in the back (literally) before departing. Why does he do this? Some choices: This may not really be the NPC; he could have been replaced by a doppleganger or shapeshifter. The NPC might be under some powerful compulsion blackmail, a variant type of charm spell, or a limited wish which temporarily makes him the villain’s minion. In any case, this inevitably leads to a final confrontation within the villain’s citadel, where the heroes find out if the NPC actually did betray them and, if so, fight him to the death. Caution: It is easy to overuse this trick. You’ll find that having the NPC betray the heroes’ trust is a bit less dramatic when the party never trusted him in the first place. 
4,<b>Villain Accompanies Party</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;In this distressing situation, the Master Villain, in disguise or his secret identity, accompanies the heroes for much of their quest. He gets to know them, learns their strengths and weaknesses, learns their plans, and just as soon as it’s most efficient for him, he thwarts their current plans and leaves, with methods like those discussed in the “NPC Turns Traitor” choice. Alternatively, the Master Villain might be with the heroes all along, up to the very end; the heroes know that one of their companions is the villain, and the whole thrust of the story is finding out who he is. This is the whole purpose of most Mystery-type adventures. 
5,<b>Villain is Related to Hero</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;In this very irritating complication, one of the heroes discovers that the Master Villain is related to him. The villain might be his long-lost father or twin; perhaps this relative is not long-lost after all, but has secretly been a Master Villain for years, and only now has the hero discovered it. (This works well with the Organizer.) This may or may not change the heroes’ plans and approach. It could be that the heroes will now try to “save” or reform the Master Villain; perhaps they won’t. It doesn’t really matter; this Cruel Trick is really not used to force the heroes to figure out a whole new approach to defeating the Master Villain. No, in actuality it’s just another way of bending the related hero’s mind and making him suffer as he has to confront and work against a relative he’d prefer not to have to oppose. 
6,<b>Wanted by the Law</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;One final complication, one which occurs pretty frequently, is when the heroes are wanted by the law. When they’re wanted by the law, they have to travel in secret and are very limited in the resources they can acquire. This becomes a very attractive Cruel Trick to play when the heroes have to have the help of the authorities to beat the villain. This means they’ll have to prove their innocence to the law before continuing perhaps having to sit around and stand trial while the Master Villain is continuing with his plan.
