# Descriptive Cavern Generator
#
#
# by Joey Joe Joe
# converted to TableSmith Sept. 2005
#
# This random generator can help you when drawing a map of a cavern
# complex before a game session or if the players unexpectedly set off
# into the Underdark and you have to 'wing it'.
#
# You can have the directions of 'left' 'right' and 'ahead' correspond
# to cardinal directions for easy mapping, or they can be vague
# descriptions that will allow more 'natural looking' maps.
#
# Sizes of 'large', 'small' etc. can reflect standards in your campaign
# or specifics of this cavern complex.
#
# Add your own chance of encounters.
#
# Modified by Valminder, Sept 2005.
#    Added some scenics with links to those tables:
#       DUN Doors.Generate1
#       DUN Dressing.Generate
