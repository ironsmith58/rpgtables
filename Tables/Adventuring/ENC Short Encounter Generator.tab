It looks as if it has been inlaid with gold, the diagrams inside with silver. It seems to radiate a strong conjuration magic. This circle is directly connected to the Lower Planes. Anyone approaching within 5' of the circle must make a Will save DC<b>{Dice~1d10+10}</b>, or find themselves drawn into the circle. As soon as any part of a PC's body crosses the plane of the circle and touches the floor beyond, there is a blinding flash of light.  When the smoke clears, the PC has vanished.<br>The circle takes the PC to the first of the Nine Levels. They are in a shadowy cave made of hot, red rock. Hazy red light filters in from the mouth of the cave, carrying the odour of sulphur. If the PCs have damaged the circle, they are stranded in the lower planes until they can find their own way out. If the circle is undamaged, all the PCs need to do to return home is to say the word `Home', and they will find themselves back in the dungeon.<br>

Concealed by the cowl of its cloak, the arcane will approach the party, and request to join them at their table. If the party agrees, the arcane sits and then proceeds to order refreshments for the group, though none for itself. It is reluctantly willing to remove the cowl, should the party ask, but will drink only water. The arcane will then ask questions, well into the wee hours. The questions range from what type of economy does the local government encourage to what colour is a healthy goat. At the end of the evening, the arcane will leave, giving each PC 2 pp for their time. During the period of questioning, the arcane will continue to buy the drinks.<br>

The %Creature% has gotten one of her %Part% caught between two tree roots. The %Creature% has been trapped for about an hour, and she has already injured herself trying to break free.<br>When she sees the party, the %Creature% will become very still and wary. If any PCs approach her she will attack wildly. If the PCs wish to save the %Creature%, they will have to find a way to calm her down. The %Creature%, speaks [~Miscellaneous.Language] and it's possible to reason with her. Casting spells might calm her, as <i>calm emotions</i>. Another option is to render her immobile without hurting her, perhaps with a <i>hold monster</i> spell. Once freed, she will be very happy. Before leaving, the %Creature% will offer to get some of her fellows and fly the PCs to their destination.<br>

The gear consists of a thick paddle (1d6 dmg)  and a leather helmet. The ball does 1d4 dmg. Since the PC has no idea of the rules, the red team constantly berates him - `You can't cross the line till the ball does, idiot!'. The black team looks on and laughs.

As the PCs slog through the swamp, the noice of gutteral laughter drifts through the air. Hulking shapes move in the mist, far enough away that their true nature is hidden. The shapes move closer, revealing them to be young {Plural~%Creature%}. They wear [~Miscellaneous.Color] rags tied around their upper arms. If the PCs also don rags of the same color on their arms, the %Creature% gang will leave them alone. They attack anyone who is not wearing a blue band. They fight to the death. The {Plural~%Creature%} have been organized into a gang by a local [~Creatures.Humanoid] shaman, who wants to control all the people and monsters in the area. The young {Plural~%Creature%} were impressed by the shaman's magic, and agreed. The PCs may later see other gangs, with similar or different colors, depending on how far the DM wants to take this idea. <br>

This zone changes the PCs perceptions and perspectives, making up seem down, left seem right, forward backward, and so forth. Language written and spoken seems backward, and the PCs `hand' changes ie, a left handed PC feels that he has become right handed, though he still suffers the penalties from using the right hand. If the PCs make a successful Intelligence check DC10, they can adjust to this new reality. Otherwise they stumble around with -4 to their attack and damage rolls, as well as skill checks and ability checks. Also, those who fail the Intelligence check (or WIS or CHA) are unable to cast spells. If any mounts or unitelligent beings pass through the zone, they go comatose for 1d20 hours. Fortunately for the PCs, the effects of the inversion vanish after 2d12 hours. But these few hours may prove dangerous, and even fatal.<br>

If the party quickly agrees to help in 2 rounds or less, the fire takes only 4 rounds to put out, but every round the PCs delay adds 2 rounds to the fire's duration.  For every round a PC fights the fire, he will take 1d4 dmg from heat and smoke. If the PCs refuse, the %Creature% will be angry, but will leave.

After the well was dug, the people let the cows drink from the pond. However, some sort of illness crept into their town after the well was dug, and the villagers fear they have angered the gods. In truth, the water from the well has been tainted, being fed from the same spring that feeds the pond. The villagers must learn to boil their water first and keep the cows away from the pond.
