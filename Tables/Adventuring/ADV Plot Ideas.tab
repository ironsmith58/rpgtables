6,A prominent deity ([~Religion.Deities2(1)]) sickens and will die if the cause of its divine malady is not discovered.
7,A beloved prophecy long accepted as true fails to occur because of the characters’ meddling, and the world turns against them.
8,A blinding, yellow haze seeps down from the sky, covering the world.
9,A celestial tree hundreds of miles long reaches its roots down and begins to grow on the world’s surface. Creatures from other worlds live in the heights of the tree.
10,A child is born who prophecy indicates will one day ascend to godhood.
11,A circle of brown blights the forest, killing all vegetation as it continues to expand without limit at an everaccelerating rate.
12,A clan of psionic militants breaks away from the kingdom — literally. A huge chunk of land hundreds of acres wide floats up and away (taking with it many terrified nonpsionic people).
13,A conjunction of parallel planes ([~Countries.Planes] and [~Countries.Planes]) somehow energizes a lowly peasant to the power of a greater deity — but only until the conjunction ends.
14,A crosstime catastrophe has cut off the Material Plane from all others.
15,A dragon kills the ruler of the largest nation and takes over, calling itself the Dragon King.

28,A new deity decides to leave the Outer Planes to set up its palace on the face of the Material Plane. Once it arrives, it demands worshipers and servitors.

36,A species of “fish” introduced from another plane (maybe [~Countries.Planes]) has provided good eating and relief from famine over the last year. Now, thousands (millions?) of the fishlike creatures begin a sudden growth spurt, transforming en masse into terribly powerful and bloodthirsty predators.
37,A splinter community of humans evolves into a subrace sporting strange and variant powers.

57,An interdimensional caravan must float on the River Styx through the dangers of several lower planes.
58,Anaxims begin to manifest from machines as complicated as simple steam-powered wheels — is it a warning from the gods of the forge to desist?
59,Angry epic druids raise the beasts, animals, and dire animals of the wild, intent on beginning a new world order in which nature comes first.
60,As the world ages, frequent earthquakes threaten to plunge the major nations under the sea.
61,Blue-skinned merchants begin to sell enormously popular items composed of dreamstuff — “mined from the very dreams of a deity,” claim the merchants.

72,Newborns begin to be born without souls.
73,Offplane raiders begin to steal people away for use as slaves and food.
74,Once every ten years a small cave provides access into a magical, underground world where all living beings give off colorful light, ruled by mysterious fey lords with mysterious agendas.

95,The woods begin to grow without bound, invading field, plain, and city.
96,The yuan-ti attempt to awaken the Slumbering Serpent, a little-known abomination born of their own race and a god of serpents.
97,Twenty percent of all astral travelers begin to disappear in mid-trip. Mid-travel diversion spells are suspected.
98,Two parallel planes ([~Countries.Planes] and [~Countries.Planes]) move too close to each other, and denizens and objects of one constantly slip onto the other, and vice versa.
99,Unless stopped, an ancient demilich will inject itself onto the Negative Energy Plane, where it can possess any undead anywhere in the multiverse.
100,When a friend or a respected associate is resurrected, the soul returned to the body has different memories from the original. Whence does this soul come?
101,Some enemy of the characters hires the Garrote (Epic Organization of assassins ELH p232) to eliminate them. (NOTE: Dangerous encounter.)
102,Some action on the part of the PCs draws the Garrote’s attention (Epic Organization of assassins ELH p232). Drawing the Garrote’s attention (and probably its ire) can happen in a number of ways. The characters might be freelancing on this organization’s turf, which never makes a guildmaster happy. Alternatively, the characters might have some sort of vested interest in a target the Garrote is going after, especially if they are members of the Order of the Shield (ELH p40). (NOTE: Dangerous encounter.)
103,The characters might come into possession of something the Gleaners (Epic Organizations ELH p234) want.
104,The Gleaners (Epic Organizations ELH p234) may contact the characters about possible work.
105,Both the heroes and the Gleaners (Epic Organizations ELH p234) want some item. Perhaps the characters need to find some artifact that allows them to solve a quest, or maybe they just stumbled across some particularly powerful item they want. Either way, if a member of the Gleaners shows up asking for the item, things are bound to get interesting. The Gleaners may be slow to try drastic measures, which means you can keep this particular issue as a minor thorn in the characters’ sides, but the Gleaners are nothing if not patient, and they can easily become a longterm adversary for the heroes.
106,The Gleaners (Epic Organizations ELH p234) may approach the characters for aid in tracking down one of their goodies. This may occur purely because of the PCs’ reputations, or it may be because of the characters’ affiliation will one or another of the other epic organizations, such as the Planar Cartographic Society (ELH p242). Gleaners commonly employ Surveyors to help them find obscure locales and survive hostile regions.
107,The former owners of something the Gleaners (Epic Organizations ELH p234) successfully retrieved rail about losing their precious possession and seek to regain it, perhaps through the services of the Order of the Shield (ELH p240) and member characters.
108,The characters create, acquire, or even witness the use of a new and unusual spell the order doesn’t have yet (Order of the Book ELH p238).
109,The Order of the Book has a need for powerful epic characters to chase down a needed spell (Order of the Book ELH p238).
110,The characters become in conflict with the Order of the Book (Epic Organizations ELH p238). There is a plot in such a way that the PCs get involved with some extremist group that believes the Order of the Book will bring about the downfall of the multiverse if it is allowed to complete the project it is working on.

# 101 Planar Adventure Ideas
# By Monte Cook, Wolfgang Baur, Colin McComb, and Ray Vallese
# We say that the planes are full of possibilities. 
#    To celebrate the release of the new planar sourcebook Beyond Countless Doorways,
#    we decided to put our money where our mouths are. So here are 101 adventure hooks
#    to jump-start your planar campaign. Some are stand-alone ideas, while others work
#    with the planes of Beyond Countless Doorways.

;PlanarAdventureIdeas
1,Adventurers find a key that opens a planar portal in mid-air; once the door is opened, the Ten Courts of Hell have an entrance to the plane. Adventurers try to close the door (see "Ten Courts of Hell" in Beyond Countless Doorways (BCD)).
2,A civilized lizardfolk ([~Names Generator.NAME Lizardfolk]) visits with a polite request for mammalian slaves to display in a circus (see "Lizard Kingdoms" in Beyond Countless Doorways (BCD))
3,A band of planar mercenaries is recruiting new members from various planes. 
4,A visiting planar scholar ([~Names Generator.NAME Random]) follows locals around taking notes on "native behavior". He won't leave and becomes incorporeal when threatened.
5,A plague of planar (from [~Countries.Planes]) refugees arrives and creates a tent city in a local town.
6,An aasimar paladin or champion of light ([~Names Generator.Celestial Names]) visits and demands that someone help him banish demons from a temple in the Nexus (see "Nexus" in Beyond Countless Doorways (BCD)).
7,A sailor of the Ethereal Sea ([~NPC Appearance.GenerateQuick5]) (see Beyond Countless doorways (BCD)) is washed up in an inn. He is pursued by vengeful cultists for theft of a sacred idol of solid emerald.
8,Locals are stalked by planar cat people who haunt the night, stealing food, mounts, and treasure.
9,A recruiter ([~NPC Appearance.GenerateQuick5]) for a successful privateer needs a druid or weather wizard for a raid; he does not mention that the ship is a flying boat on another plane (see "Uomo" in Beyond Countless Doorways (BCD)).
10,A flying pirate ship slips through a planar portal and crash lands (see "Venomheart" in Beyond Countless Doorways (BCD)).
11,A group of pilgrims ([Group Designer.Generate(5)]) seeks help getting to Mother Ocean (see "Uomo" in Beyond Countless Doorways (BCD)).
12,A group of evil psionicists ([Group Designer.Generate(5)]) approaches local mercenaries asking for help destroying a party of pilgrims to Mother Ocean (see "Uomo" in Beyond Countless Doorways (BCD)).
13,A talking horse claims to be from another plane, and that it can carry riders across planar boundaries. In fact, it is a trap, a shapeshifting yamado (see "The Ten Courts of Hell" in Beyond Countless Doorways (BCD)).
14,A hell judge ([~Names Generator.Demonic Names]) wants to retire and sends a letter to a mortal for help (see "The Ten Courts of Hell" in Beyond Countless Doorways (BCD)).
15,A wizard's experiment goes horribly wrong, releasing elemental spirits and fiery salamanders throughout the land. To gather them up, someone must find or make a spirit bottle.
16,A trogolodyte planar merchant ([~Troglodyte Names.Start]) arrives with exotic metal goods and tall tales. He might be willing to hire some guards, cheap (see "Lizard Kingsdoms" in Beyond Countless Doorways (BCD)).
17,The inhabitant of a prison plane has escaped.
